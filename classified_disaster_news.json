        "content": "This past August, Punjab, India experienced the worst flooding from monsoon rains in the area in over four decades — precipitating a statewide crisis that submerged 1,400 villages in 13 districts. At least 51 people were killed and approximately 400,000 displaced.\n\nWith communities still reeling from the natural disaster, the last thing the people of Punjab are doing is acting like a victim, says Jaskaran Sandhu, an Indo-Canadian civil lawyer who is also on the board of the World Sikh Organization (WSO), the predominant religion of the northwestern Indian state.\n\n“The destruction and the death toll was significantly mitigated by grassroots forces,” he tells Yahoo Canada from his law office in Calgary. “There has also been humanitarian aid and support from the diaspora in Canada and around the world.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile critics have slammed the Indian government for slow — or lack thereof — responses to the disaster, Canadian Sikhs have helped raise millions to help rebuild amid the historic flood across Punjab province.\n\nIndian army personnel rescue flood-affected residents and their dog on a boat across the engorged Beas river at Baoopur village in Kapurthala district in India's Punjab state on August 30, 2025.

The sentiment for a foreign country’s natural disaster woes before his own sparked many to call out his apparent lack of care and concern for Punjab.\n\n“What about Punjab? Punjab is flooded. Not a single word for Punjab. People are losing lives, houses, fields, livestock,” responded one X user.\n\nPunjabis' perception is that 'government is distant and uncaring about them as a people'\n\nBut why was the response so slow for a crisis in the state of his own country?\n\n“Modi and the BJP government [Bharat Janata Party — the country’s Hindu nationalist political party] are not the type to stay silent on things,” Sandhu says. “As Punjab is battered by the worst flood in decades — and which have brought about an unprecedented level of damage — it lends itself to the very real perception by Punjabis that the central government is distant and uncaring about them as a people.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPunjab has a long history of feeling like a second-class state in its own country.\n\nThe region feels like it ranks last for a number of reasons: Being a national minority is one of them.\n\n“It’s one of only four states that doesn’t have a Hindu majority,” Sandhu says. “Punjab also has a history of voting against the BJP, so there’s no incentive for the central government to care about us.”\n\nBut when the need is reversed, like when there is a conflict between India and Pakistan, Punjab, as a border state to Pakistan, has to suffer decisions it has no control over. Many Punjabis feel that it makes no sense to continue to sacrifice themselves for an ungrateful government.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis disillusionment with Delhi, India’s capital, has often incited separatist notions. For this reason, “India treats Punjab like an existential threat that needs to be constantly stamped out.”\n\nThere is also distrust in the state government. “Bhagwant Mann has been inept at addressing and working on resolving the destruction that has taken place since the floods,” Sandhu says, referring to Punjab’s chief minister (equivalent to a Canadian province's premier).\n\n“Their drive right now is to ask for donations for state coffers so that they can provide humanitarian support and rebuilding efforts. But the community’s response has been, ‘We’re already going through grassroots organizations and have been mobilizing ourselves and getting donations directly through Sikh aid organizations and temples, so why would we need to wait on you?’ The criticism is that the state government hasn’t really done anything to advocate for Punjab.”\n\nFrom bad to worse: 'Central government has played a big role in the floods'\n\nOf course, it could be because the state government is beholden to the Modi government. But there is also a bigger picture issue at play as to why the PM was particularly silent about the floods, at least in the beginning, Sandhu believes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“The central government has played a big role in the floods,” he says. The nature in which Punjab’s dams and canals are being managed is a major problem. “Heavy rainfall is one thing, but the way in which the water has been released out of the dam was optimized for the maximum amount of damage. The water was released in a way that made it very difficult — impossible even — to manage the outflow.”\n\nSandhu says to make matters worse, the canal that feeds Punjab’s waters to neighbouring states like Rajasthan, were shut as well. “So those floodwaters didn’t have anywhere to escape; it just pooled in Punjab. The frustration for Punjab is ‘You’ve built these canals where you extract water, depleting Punjab’s water tables and the riparian rights, and you refuse to negotiate and work with Punjab on the main sticking point.” That point involves water rights in Punjab and drier states like Rajasthan trying to extract water with the help of the central government.\n\n“But when there’s a flood and we need to mitigate floodwaters, everyone shuts those canals down. In good times you’re extracting water, and in bad times you’re shutting those canals down so that there’s no outflow.”\n\nSandhu thinks that’s the bigger problem here. “The central government has mismanaged the water release of the dams and they’ve mismanaged canal operations. This is a natural disaster that the government has an immense role in manufacturing — whether by incompetence or a lack of care.” Modi and the BJP are unable to address that legitimate critique in any meaningful way, he continues. “So they have chosen silence.”\n\nAid from government nowhere near enough\n\nOn Sept. 9, the prime minister did a flyover of Punjab to conduct an aerial survey to assess the damage. He also visited the city of Gurdaspur to interact with flood victims. The central government also announced 1,600 Crore in financial aid, but critics say it’s nowhere near enough to compensate for damages and rebuild.\n\nThe central government has mismanaged the water release of the dams and they’ve mismanaged canal operations.\n\nThe immediate, most pressing concern for Punjabis continues to be solving the problems at hand, says Sandhu. “It’s repairing infrastructure that is water-bogged; it’s fixing tractors and getting equipment so that farmers can tend to the fields again. It’s also removing sand silt that got washed onto agricultural land, making it difficult to cultivate. And of course, it’s getting homes livable again.”\n\nSikhs in Canada respond: 'The real story is a community story'\n\nThe reaction from Sikhs in Canada as well as around the world has been to immediately raise funds and support everyone back home. “Sikhs in Canada are very well-connected to Punjab: We all have family and friends and sometimes even land back home,” Sandhu says. “Punjabi-Canadian radio stations have raised millions for example, as have Gurdwaras [Sikh temples].”\n\nSikhs in Canada are very well-connected to Punjab: We all have family and friends and sometimes even land back home.\n\nREDFM, Canada’s largest South Asian media network with radio stations in Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary, ran a live on-air radiothon this past September to help raise funds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“It started early in the morning and went well into the evening — about 12 hours of continuous broadcasting,” says program director Pooja Sekhon. “Throughout the day, we had hosts sharing stories, and volunteers were taking live calls from people making donations. It was emotional, energetic, and really moving to see the momentum building as the day went on.”\n\nThe result: $2.2 million were raised as a coordinated effort across the three cities.\n\n“Each city brought its own energy, its own set of callers, and local businesses who got involved,” Sekhon adds. The funds have been directed to SAF International, a registered Canadian charitable organization that works closely with partner organizations in Punjab.\n\n“Together, they’ll be collaborating on rebuilding efforts in the affected communities.”\n\nSandhu believes that what we have witnessed in the aftermath of the Punjab floods is a deep reflection of how much Punjabis do right as a community.\n\n“The real story is a community story.”"

        "content": "The Pacific Northwest is being taken for a ride, and a major earthquake off the coast of Oregon this week was the latest jolt reminding residents just how fragile the region’s future really is.\n\nThe 4.2 magnitude quake struck nearly 200 miles from the coastal town of Barview. It was the third such seismic event in the area in the last two weeks, part of a swarm that scientists say could signal an upcoming eruption of Axial Seamount, an underwater shield volcano that last erupted in 2015.\n\n\"There's still a chance it could erupt by the end of the year. We don't really know exactly when it will happen, but nothing seems imminent since the number of earthquakes per day is relatively low,\" Bill Chadwick a researcher at Oregon State University, told the Daily Mail.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut the quake swarm is only the surface-level warning. The real threat comes from the much larger system grinding beneath the region: The Cascadia Subduction Zone—a 700-mile fault that runs all the way from California to British Columbia—where two giant tectonic plates are locked in a high-stakes standoff. The North American plate is slowly crushing the Juan de Fuca plate beneath it, according to experts, lifting the region millimeter by millimeter over centuries. But that pressure won’t build forever.\n\nWhen the plates finally slip, they’ll unleash what scientists call a megathrust earthquake, or “the great quake” in layman's terms. This magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake will be capable of violently shaking the region for minutes and triggering a massive tsunami.\n\nBut there’s another, less visible threat that could have longer-lasting consequences: subsidence, or the sinking of land. In a matter of minutes, entire coastal communities could drop by up to 6 feet, permanently redrawing the floodplain and placing thousands of homes and lives at risk.\n\nNew research shows subsidence following the great quake could double, or even triple, the number of people and properties exposed to catastrophic flooding—an impact that most flood maps and insurance models still fail to capture.\n\nWhat is subsidence (and why it matters more than you think)?\n\nMake your hands into fists and press them hard against each other. Now, tilt one fist upward, like it’s riding over the other. When the pressure becomes too much, one fist suddenly slips past the other and, in an instant, drops.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNow, imagine your fists are the Earth’s crust. That drop is called subsidence.\n\n“During one of these over magnitude 8, probably up to magnitude 9 earthquakes, the land actually deforms and drops down up to 6 feet or 2 meters,” explains Tina Dura, a coastal geologist and lead researcher on a new study examining flood exposure in the Pacific Northwest recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“Basically causing sea level rise of 6 feet within minutes.”\n\nThis instant ground-level drop doesn’t just mean higher tides. It redefines the baseline for future flooding. Areas that were once safely above water could suddenly become permanent flood zones, or even become permanently under water—changing the region’s coastline, increasing insurance costs, and putting thousands of homes at risk.\n\nWhat happens to coastal communities when the ground drops\n\nThe last time a megathrust earthquake rocked the Pacific Northwest was centuries ago, long before cities, suburbs, and infrastructure blanketed the region’s coast. But scientists like Dura are looking to the geologic record to understand what the quake left behind, and what could happen when the next one strikes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Cascadia has repeatedly dropped down up to 6 feet in these earthquakes,” she explains. “We find these marsh soils that are overlain by really clean gray tidal mud, showing that these wetlands dropped down and were converted to tidal flats repeatedly.”\n\nIn other words, when the ground sank, the ocean rushed in, flooding areas that were once comfortably above water.\n\n“On the coastal records, we can look back about 7,000 years or so, and [we’re] seeing these catastrophic changes in these estuaries,” she adds. “I'm constantly thinking about the land level change that's going to occur.”\n\n\n\nThat land level change is what makes subsidence so dangerous. What was once safe, dry ground could become a flood-prone tidal flat in a matter of minutes. And while the region once held quiet wetlands, it’s now home to entire communities.\n\nThe risks go far beyond flooded basements. Entire systems critical to public safety and daily life could be thrown into crisis. Wastewater treatment plants, electric substations, and roads built at elevations sensitive to sea level rise could be compromised.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen the coastline drops, so does everything built on it, putting lives, homes, and infrastructure directly in harm’s way.\n\nA doubling, and eventually tripling, of exposure\n\nUntil recently, most models focused on immediate impacts: shaking, waves, and storm surges. But Dura’s new research reveals what happens when you factor in subsidence—and the results are startling.\n\nIf a megathrust earthquake were to happen today, the 100-year floodplain—the key metric used to determine which homes are at risk of flood, and what homes need to purchase flood insurance policies—expands by 115 square miles.\n\n“That doubles the exposure of resident structures and roads,” Dura explains.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn other words, half of the residents who would need flood insurance to cover damage caused by flooding following a megathrust earthquake are unlikely to know that they are at risk right now. And that’s just the start.\n\nBy 2100, due to the combined effects of sea-level rise from global warming, the floodplain expands by 145 square miles, tripling the exposure.\n\nThat one-two punch is a combo that few current models account for.\n\n“The studies that have been conducted so far ... haven’t really taken into account the long-term impacts of the subsidence,” Dura notes.\n\nThe result: a massive blind spot in our understanding of flood risk in the Pacific Northwest. And without that knowledge, thousands of homeowners might be dramatically underestimating their need for flood insurance.\n\nWhat homeowners can do now to understand and reduce risk\n\nJust one inch of floodwater can cause up to $25,000 in damage, according to FEMA. Yet, as Janet Ruiz of the Insurance Information Institute warns, flood damage and “damage from a tsunami is not covered under most standard homeowners, renters, or business insurance.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor homeowners in the Pacific Northwest, Dura’s study offers a critical opportunity to get ahead of that risk.\n\n“Residents can use our maps to locate themselves ... to see whether their house might lie within one of the projected post-earthquake floodplains,” she says.\n\nEven homes outside FEMA-designated flood zones could be pulled into future floodplains in an instant, making flood insurance a smart move now, before disaster strikes.\n\n“The major insurer of flood is the National Flood Insurance Program ... [which] provides coverage up to $250,000 for a structure and $100,000 for personal possessions,” Ruiz notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat might not be enough. Flooding following a tsunami triggered by the megathrust earthquake could destroy entire homes, not just damage the first floor, so owners of higher-value homes might need additional protection.\n\nAnd the risk isn’t only long-term. Areas newly vulnerable to subsidence might also start experiencing nuisance flooding, king tides, and coastal erosion well before the next major quake hits.\n\n“Twenty-five percent of flooding happens outside the designated flood zones,” Ruiz adds, which makes proactive planning even more essential.\n\nHomeowners should start by taking the following steps:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLocating their property on Dura’s projected floodplain maps.\n\nComparing National Flood Insurance Program policies with options from private insurers.\n\nReassessing their property’s flood risk based on elevation, proximity to water, and changing coastal conditions.\n\nHow likely is this ‘next great quake’?\n\nScientists refer to recurrence intervals to estimate how often major earthquakes occur on a given fault. For the Cascadia Subduction Zone, the geological record shows a pattern of megathrust quakes occurring roughly every 250 to 800 years.\n\n“We’re over 300 years out from the last earthquake,” says Dura. “Geologically speaking, we’re well within the window of possibility.”\n\nIn human terms, that can seem abstract, but the odds are very real. Unlike storms or seasonal weather events, earthquakes strike without warning, and the longer the buildup, the greater the risk.\n\n“Fifty years in geologic time is well within our plus or minus uncertainty,” Dura adds. “It really could happen any day.”"

        "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAn Atlantic hurricane season defined by political and climate disasters comes to a close on November 30th.\n\nIt kicked off after DOGE’s flurry of slashes to federal agencies. Employees who stayed on endured a tumultuous year, to say the least, at the National Weather Service (NWS). A series of strong storms brewed in the Atlantic this season. But for the first time in a decade, no hurricane made landfall in the US — sparing most Americans the worst of the season.\n\n“That was a much needed break.”\n\n“That was a much needed break,” Neil Jacobs, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) administrator, said in a November 25 press release.\n\nThis was a season of “striking contrast,” according to NOAA, which encompasses the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center. After a relatively quiet start, there were sudden “bursts of intense activity.”\n\nAs far as the number of storms, it was a pretty average season with 13 named storms, five hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. Those major hurricanes, however, were doozies. Three reached Category 5 strength, with the most severe winds on the Saffir-Simpson scale. That puts this year in the second top spot on record for Category 5 storms in a single season.\n\nWarmer sea surface temperatures provide more heat energy for tropical storms, leading to hurricanes that are more intense than they would have been without climate change. “The storms that formed just exploded in their extreme rapid intensification,” Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist and vice president for engagement at nonprofit research group Climate Central, said in a Covering Climate Now press briefing earlier this month.\n\nAnother Category 5 storm, Hurricane Erin, caused erosion along a vast swath of the east coast from Massachusetts to North Carolina in August, according to Woods Placky. In September, Category 5 storm Humberto and Hurricane Imelda plunged several North Carolina coastal homes into the Atlantic without ever making landfall.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season kicks up again in June of next year, although early spring storms have been enough to lead the World Meteorological Organization to consider moving the start date up into May in recent years."

        "content": "FEMA promised funds to tsunami-proof an Oregon hospital. That money is MIA\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\nEight years ago, Erik Thorsen — CEO of Columbia Memorial Hospital in Astoria, Ore. — received a warning that no hospital administrator wants to hear: A big earthquake could cause his hospital's building to collapse. His staff and his patients could die in a matter of moments.\n\n\"They basically said, 'None of you are prepared for a major natural disaster from the Cascadia subduction zone,'\" recalls Thorsen.\n\nThe Cascadia subduction zone is an earthquake-prone region that stretches about 700 miles from California to British Columbia. Thorsen's hospital sits right along it — which is why a team of experts and engineers from the state had come to talk to him and other leaders from coastal hospitals about earthquake risk.\n\nAlarmed, Thorsen — who grew up in this area, left for college, and then returned to raise his family here — got to work fundraising and planning in order to fortify his hospital to withstand an earthquake and provide shelter during a tsunami.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA critical part of the project's $300 million budget was to come from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Their $14 million grant would help to build a tsunami evacuation zone in the hospital.\n\nBut in April, the Trump administration canceled the grant program that awarded the funding, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. A report from the Urban Institute estimates this cancellation jeopardizes over $3 billion nationally in hazard mitigation funds to protect communities from threats like floods, wildfires, tornadoes and hurricanes.\n\nWhen the news reached Astoria, construction plans were already well under way.\n\n\"We did go back to the design team and say, 'What would it take to actually take these elements out?'\" says Mark Kujala, a Clatsop County commissioner who worked on fundraising for the project. \"And because it's so integrated into the project, that just wasn't feasible.\"\n\nThe hospital broke ground in September. The current plan for filling the $14 million hole left by FEMA: There is no plan.\n\n\"Unfortunately, FEMA — even prior to the shutdown, had kind of gone silent on us,\" says Thorsen. \"And now with the shutdown … very silent on us.\"\n\nNo worse place to locate a hospital\n\nColumbia Memorial Hospital was constructed in its current location in 1977, when earthquake risk was not as well understood. In addition to being constructed in a zone vulnerable to a major earthquake, the hospital sits in a low-lying plain just blocks from the waterfront, on unstable ground.\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\n\"The theory is if the earthquake happened, that ground underneath us would liquefy and the building would potentially collapse,\" says Thorsen. \"If we happen to remain upright and a tsunami comes our way, maybe we get 20 to 30 minutes of notice to evacuate people up the hill.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat would mean moving vulnerable patients — in some cases, critically ill patients — out of their environment and into another, in the middle of a disaster zone, in a matter of minutes. Other earthquake-prone places like Japan have already built such structures to avoid this scenario by moving to higher ground within their buildings. But Oregon is late to the game, some experts say.\n\n\" We're sitting here on — you know the overused phrase — [a] ticking time bomb,\" says Chris Goldfinger, who studies paleoseismology at Oregon State University.\n\nA magnitude 9 earthquake, says Goldfinger, is a realistic possibility in the Cascadia subduction zone.\n\n\"Those happen on average just under [once every] 500 years,\" says Goldfinger. \"We're 325 years since the last one.\"\n\nAt least 25,000 people could die in this scenario, according to some estimates.\n\nThere are only three hospitals in Oregon in this region.\n\n\"Honestly, with this project, we could be the only hospital that could survive and serve the residents — for about 60,000 people,\" says Thorsen. \"It's a big responsibility.\"\n\nCurrently the hospital is a sprawling, one-story building, and modeling has predicted that several feet of water could flood the hospital's ground floor during a tsunami. When it is complete, the new hospital will be dramatically taller, growing from one story to four (plus a fifth level for a helipad). The idea behind the vertical evacuation zone is that once the earthquake has stopped and the new building is still standing, people can congregate in the top several floors, built especially to be able to withstand a tsunami.\n\ntoggle caption ZGF Architects\n\nIn order to help mitigate that potential disaster, engineers designed a plan to anchor the hospital to bedrock 65 feet deep. \"The building is 97 feet and the helipad sits on the roof,\" says Thorsen, gesturing to the hospital and describing its new design. A 100-foot drill — basically an enormous version of the kind of drill bit one might find in a household toolbox — is already making deep holes to secure the piles.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough the Pacific Northwest is beginning to build these kinds of structures, Goldfinger says, they're hard to finance without federal support. \"The federal government is really the only entity that's large enough to deal with this as a national-level problem,\" he says. \"It's just well beyond anything that the states could do alone.\"\n\n\"It is just incredibly frustrating\"\n\nThough Thorsen and his staff say they were given some indication that existing BRIC grants would still be distributed, they've yet to see any money.\n\nThe BRIC program was established under the first Trump administration in order to fortify communities against natural disasters. After it was canceled, a lawsuit challenged the program's termination and a federal judge issued an injunction.\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\n\"It is just incredibly frustrating,\" says Democratic Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, who represents the area. Bonamici says she and her staff have been pleading with anyone who will listen to help access the money.\n\n\" I lost count of how many calls I have made, trying to get somebody from FEMA on the phone,\" says Bonamici.\n\nFEMA did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nPlans for a new hospital, says Bonamici, provided her peace of mind about a potential catastrophe in her district. Some predictions forecast a magnitude 9 earthquake here could be the worst natural disaster the U.S. has ever seen.\n\n\"It is going to be a safe place not just for patients or employees in the hospital, but for the community, \" says Bonamici. \"They can't outrun a tsunami. \"\n\nIn addition to saving lives, she says, the project will save property and money. \"It is really critical that — now that they're underway with construction — this funding comes through.\"\n\nWaste, fraud, and abuse hits different at a local level\n\nWhen Trump officials started talking about cutting \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" Willis Van Dusen was enthusiastic. A registered Republican, Van Dusen was mayor of Astoria for more than two decades. Eliminating waste, he says, is what he and fellow Republicans wanted.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"This is what Trump ran on,\" he says.\n\nBut when Trump's \"waste, fraud and abuse\" campaign came to his town, Van Dusen says he felt differently. \"What is more important than a hospital in a rural community like Astoria?\" he asks.\n\nAstoria has a history as a fishing and logging town, but more recently it's given way to big-city retirees and craft breweries. It's a rare, politically moderate area — a place, says Van Dusen, where neighborhoods are socioeconomically mixed and people are typically more concerned with questions of practical issues like trash collection than identity politics.\n\nFew issues are more practical than having a trusted hospital nearby, says Van Dusen. When he had a heart attack some years ago, it was doctors at Columbia Memorial who brought him back. \"I had actually died,\" he says, pointing to a framed EKG reading he keeps in his office.\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\nMaking sure that this hospital can keep providing care during an earthquake and tsunami, he says, is the opposite of waste, fraud and abuse.\n\n\"Just to jerk that money away from us,\" he says, \"it makes me livid.\"\n\nVan Dusen says he's not the only one in this town who's mad, regardless of political party. \"Every single Republican that I have talked to is livid over what's happening,\" he adds.\n\nHospital CEO Erik Thorsen says they are not giving up — even without the federal money. Construction continues. They've been thinking through other ways to finance it.\n\nThorsen feels a responsibility for protecting this community where he has spent most of his life. \"We have this obligation to make sure that our patients and our residents and citizens are safe,\" he says.\n\nWithout the federal government, though, the path ahead is unclear.\n\n"

The scale of Melissa — which bombarded Jamaica, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic with sustained winds of 185 mph — is unprecedented, which is makes it all the more bizarre to see fake AI-generated images of the storm go viral.\n\nWhile sharing doctored images in the aftermath of a disaster is a decade-long tradition at this point, Yale’s Climate Connections blog notes that generative AI is now making crisis misinformation worse than it’s ever been.\n\nOne of the most flagrant pieces of disinfo surrounding Hurricane Melissa is an AI generated picture purporting to show the system from miles above the ground. The image shows an absolutely mammoth hurricane eye, punctuated by a flock of birds circling safely above.\n\nYet as retired meteorologist and National Weather Service science and operations office Rich Grumm told Yale’s CC, the scale of the image simply doesn’t work — Melissa’s eye was reported to be around 10 miles wide.\n\n“Based on the scale of the eye, these birds would be larger than football fields,” Grumm told CC.\n\nAnd as former meteorology professor at Penn State University, Lee Grenci told the blog, “these birds would have to have been flying at altitudes well above the summit of Mount Everest” for this image to be real.\n\n“The air temperature and air density are way too low for birds to fly,” Grenci commented. Sure enough, as the fake image was going viral, a daring crew of hurricane hunters demonstrated the physical limits of weather observation flights when they punched through the storm wall and into Melissa’s eye, capturing some jaw dropping footage of the monster system.\n\nAs far as the fake image goes, it seems to have kicked off on X-formerly-Twitter at around 1am EST on October 28, but soon began making the rounds all over Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Meta’s Threads, earning tens of thousands of reactions. With dozens of various accounts posting the exact same image, it’s likely the post spread with the help of a coordinated bot farm.\n\n“I’ve never seen the ‘stadium effect’ so pronounced and well-defined,” one poster said on X, uploading the AI image alongside a real one. “This will be in meteorology textbooks.”\n\nYale’s CC notes this isn’t the only piece of AI-misinformation surrounding Hurricane Melissa. Another bit of viral slop appeared to show a Jamaican hospital completely decimated by the storm, though fact checkers quickly identified a SynthID stamp, an invisible watermark embedded into content made with Google’s AI tools.\n\nStill, it’s impossible to tell the harm it might have caused — it’s not hard to imagine scenarios where those seeking help may have been convinced an otherwise still-functioning hospital is completely destroyed.\n\nIt’s yet another example of the dangerous rise in AI-generated misinformation, and a reminder that this is one genie we won’t be putting back into the bottle anytime soon.\n\nMore on AI: Slop Farmer Boasts About How He Uses AI to Flood Social Media With Garbage to Trick Older Women\n\n"

        "content": "As the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season ends, the future of forecasting is AI\n\ntoggle caption Ricardo Makyn/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMIAMI — The Atlantic hurricane season, which draws to an official close on Sunday, fulfilled forecasts it would be an active year.\n\nThere were 13 named storms and three Category 5 hurricanes. But, for the first time in a decade, a hurricane did not make landfall in the U.S.\n\nThe season's most destructive hurricane, Melissa, was one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever. It slammed Jamaica with 185 mph winds, devastating communities and killing dozens of people.\n\nA week before the hurricane made landfall, however, forecast models disagreed on where it would go. One model that got it right — accurately predicting Melissa's path and its Category 5 intensity — was a new one: Google's DeepMind AI-based hurricane model.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLoading...\n\nJames Franklin, a former branch chief at the National Hurricane Center, analyzed how the forecast models performed this year and says Google's DeepMind outshone them all. \"The model performed very, very well, which was very impressive,\" he says. \"It was the best guidance we saw this year.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence has been used in weather forecast models for some time. Google's DeepMind, though, marks a significant step forward, one that suggests AI may soon overtake the physics-based models meteorologists have long relied on.\n\nModels like the Global Forecast System — the GFS — developed by NOAA, are based on equations that calculate how wind, moisture and heat move around in the atmosphere. The models utilize these equations to predict what might happen in the atmosphere, including the track and intensity of hurricanes.\n\ntoggle caption James Franklin\n\nAI models like Google's DeepMind, on the other hand, don't know anything about physics but focus instead on history. \"They have been developed to go back and look at historical records and tease out patterns and relationships about what has happened in the past in very subtle ways that a person could not extract on their own,\" Franklin says.\n\nTo develop their hurricane model, engineers at Google worked closely with scientists at the National Hurricane Center and Colorado State University's Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere. Kate Musgrave, a research scientist at CIRA, analyzes the performance of AI-based models, including the one developed by Google.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe says in the past, AI models did well with one part of a hurricane forecast — tracking the path of a storm, \"Because that is governed by large-scale influences in the atmosphere. Intensity, however, how strong a storm will be, is not captured well in the AI models.\" But the Google model did very well in forecasting intensity, she says, because it added historical data detailing how past hurricanes developed.\n\nMusgrave believes AI modeling may be the future not just for hurricanes, but also in forecasting other weather phenomena, everything from tornadoes to cold snaps.\n\nAs for hurricanes, as AI models develop, she believes meteorologists will be able to forecast tracks and intensity earlier than ever before, a vital improvement. She says, \"As the coastlines get more populated, we need more and more time to get people out of the way. So, forecasts further and further into the future become more important.\"\n\ntoggle caption Clarens Siffroy/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has embraced the new Google DeepMind model, referencing it in many of its forecast discussions, particularly as it tracked Hurricane Melissa.\n\nWallace Hogsett, a science operations officer at the National Hurricane Center, says, \"I think it's clear at this point that AI will be a component of the hurricane forecast process going forward.\" Additional AI models are under development by NOAA and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. He says, \"I expect that this pace of innovation will keep up.\"\n\nBut for forecasters used to seeing data on wind, pressure, humidity and sea surface temperature and how it's interpreted by the physics-based models, former NHC forecaster Franklin says relying on AI can be unsettling.\n\n\"AI models are something like a black box to a forecaster,\" he says. \"A lot of data goes in. You get a forecast that comes out. But you don't really know how it came up with that.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough AI models will become increasingly important, Franklin and Musgrave don't expect them to replace either long-standing physics-based models or the judgment of experienced forecasters."

        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The man accused of sparking the deadly wildfire that ripped through a Los Angeles neighborhood in January must remain jailed while he awaits trial, a judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nFederal officials have said Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, started a small fire on New Year’s Day that smoldered underground before reigniting nearly a week later and roaring through coastal Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many of Los Angeles’ rich and famous. The fire, which left 12 dead in the hillside neighborhoods, was one of two blazes that broke out on Jan. 7, killing more than 30 people in all and destroying over 17,000 homes and buildings while burning for days in Los Angeles County.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Rozella A. Oliver denied his bond, saying he must be kept in custody due to his mental health and distress he caused his sister and her family. Rinderknecht’s father testified in support of his release, denying that his son had mental health issues.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRinderknecht was arrested Oct. 7 in Florida, where he staying at his sister’s house. A judge ordered that he remain jailed after a prosecutor said he had traits of an arsonist and his family had worried about his declining mental state. Prosecutors also argued Rinderknecht was a flight risk because he had family in France and spoke French.\n\nHe was brought to Los Angeles about two weeks later and pleaded not guilty in court.\n\nRinderknecht's sister offered him $10,000 to leave her house\n\nProsecutors mentioned two incidents during Rinderknecht's time in Florida when his sister and her husband called 911 because they were concerned about his behavior.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I’m afraid that when he’s triggered ... he might actually use his gun,” his father told law enforcement in body camera footage.\n\nOne time, Rinderknecht got into an argument with his sister after finding out she had cancer, telling her that she should become vegan.\n\nHe also told her he would burn her house down.\n\nLess than a week later, Rinderknecht had an argument with his father, who was visiting from France, and told him that he had purchased a gun. He said he bought it because his relationship with his sister's husband was worsening and would use if attacked.\n\nHis sister told law enforcement that he was “sensitive and volatile” and they felt like they were “walking on eggshells” around him, especially with young children in the home, Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Alexander said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt one point he told his sister, \"If I wanted to kill you guys I could’ve done that a long time ago,\" his sister said in body camera footage. She called him angry, paranoid, and delusional.\n\nRinderknecht's sister and her husband offered to pay for his move back to California and give him $10,000 if he left their home voluntarily, but he refused unless they gave him $25,000, Alexander said. His sister and her husband moved out instead.\n\n“I don't want to be in the house with my kids with him and a gun,” his sister said in body camera footage.\n\nDespite these incidents, his father said Rinderknecht's sister and her husband were willing to have him back in their Florida home, and put up $100,000 for his bond. His father said he and Rinderknecht's mom were willing to move back from France and watch over him.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe family is \"very supportive of him,” his father said. “They are ... upset that Jonathan is being accused of things he hasn't done.”\n\nRinderknecht was indicted on one charge of malicious destruction by means of a fire, one count of arson affecting property used in interstate commerce, and one count of timber set afire. If convicted, he would face up to 20 years in federal prison.\n\nHis trial is scheduled for April 21, 2026.\n\nAttorney blames fire department for not putting out initial blaze\n\nFederal officials called the Palisades blaze a “holdover fire” from the Jan. 1 fire that Rinderknecht is accused of starting, which was not fully extinguished by firefighters. LA’s interim fire chief said such fires linger in root systems and can reach depths of 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 meters), making them undetectable by thermal imaging cameras.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRinderknecht's attorney Steve Haney has said that even if Rinderknecht was the cause of the initial smaller fire on New Year’s Day, there were several “intervening factors” in the week between that day and when the Palisades Fire ignited, mainly the Los Angeles Fire Department's response to the fire.\n\nHaney said after the bond hearing that he's contemplated whether his client can get a fair trial in Southern California or whether it needs to be held elsewhere.\n\n“Jonathan is being scapegoated for governmental failures,” Haney said. “There's no way that the Palisades Fire should have ever happened. It happened because (the LAFD) didn't do their job.”\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the Los Angeles Times, firefighters mopping up the initial fire were ordered to leave the area even though they complained the ground was still smoldering and rocks remained hot to the touch. Mayor Karen Bass’ new pick for fire chief, Jaime Moore, has promised to commission an outside investigation into the matter.\n\n“We're going to get those text messages,” Haney said."

        "content": "Republican Cory Bowman, half brother of Vice President JD Vance, is challenging Democratic incumbent Aftab Pureval for Cincinnati mayor.\n\nPureval is considered the frontrunner after winning the primary with 83% of the vote compared to Bowman's 13%.\n\nVice President Vance has not been publicly involved in his half-brother's campaign beyond a social media endorsement.\n\nIt's not been a typical mayoral race in Cincinnati.\n\nFirst off, Republicans don't often run for mayor of Cincinnati, a city that has voted 3-to-1 Democratic in recent presidential elections. The last Republican to run for mayor, Brad Wenstrup, lost to Mark Mallory in 2009. It worked out for Wenstrup, though, when he rolled his mayoral campaign into a 12-year congressional career.\n\nThis time around, the Republican candidate for Cincinnati mayor also happens to be Vice President JD Vance's half-brother: Cory Bowman, a pastor at a church in Cincinnati's West End.\n\nDespite, or maybe because of, Bowman's personal relationship to the White House, Bowman faces a steep climb to unseat Democratic incumbent Aftab Pureval.\n\n\"We’ll just say I think a Bowman win would be a political earthquake,\" said Xavier University Political Science Professor Mack Mariani. \"It would be a tsunami, Sharknado, earthquake combination. It’s a very Democratic city, as most urban cities are.\"\n\nEarly voting started Oct. 7. Election Day is Nov. 4.\n\nIs the race competitive?\n\nWhile Bowman survived a three-way mayoral primary in May, he finished a distant second with 13% of the vote, well behind Pureval's 83%. Bowman supporters point to the low turnout in the primary, in which only 10% of registered voters showed up to the polls.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm from political donors on either side. Compared to the previous mayoral election, little has been spent and raised by either candidate. The races are officially nonpartisan but party politics play a big role in the campaigns.\n\nPureval has outraised Bowman so far, raising $311,913 this year compared to Bowman's $56,033 as of the last reports filed in October. Pureval has even garnered the support of prominent Republican donors Carl Lindner III and Martha Lindner. They have given thousands of dollars to Republican causes over the years, including $844,000 each to President Donald Trump.\n\nThey both donated $1,100 to Pureval.\n\nThe campaigns have largely played out online and door-to-door. Bowman and the Republicans running for Cincinnati City Council have campaigned under a \"Flip the 'Nati\" slogan. Pureval's slogan is \"Strength in Unity.\" Democrats control city government, from mayor to all nine City Council members.\n\nPureval said he's out door-knocking most evenings. Does he see the race as competitive?\n\n\"I would refer you to the primary,\" Pureval told The Enquirer, referring to the primary in which he outperformed Bowman by 70 percentage points.\n\n\"I'm out in the community every weekend, most evenings, and the feedback I'm getting is that they're encouraged about the future,\" he said.\n\nBowman said he's got a lean campaign staff of a \"handful of people.\" He declined to name his campaign manager publicly because they've been targeted by threats, he said.\n\n\"We're just keeping it simple, keeping it on door knocking, keeping it on signage, keeping it on just getting our message out to as many people as we can,\" Bowman said.\n\nDark time for Bowman campaign after the primary\n\nRight after the primary, Bowman's campaign went quiet with few public statements or appearances.\n\nBowman told The Enquirer at the time he was regrouping. Behind the scenes Bowman said he knew he faced long odds, he told supporters in September.\n\n\"When we got out of the primary, to be honest with you, based on everything going on, I kind of went in a cave,\" Bowman said at a fundraiser in September in Corryville. \"Because I was like, 'Hey we're making a stand right now. We're going to November, but there's not really a shot of this.'\"\n\nSo in June, Bowman said he found himself behind the counter of his coffee shop he owns across the street from his church in the West End. He said he heard customer after customer, many police officers, voice various complaints about city leadership. That feedback gave his campaign motivation, he said.\n\nCrime brought more attention to the race\n\nThen a brawl broke out on Cincinnati's Fourth Street in the early morning hours of July 26. The videos of people shouting, taking fighting stances and getting pummeled went viral. It hit on issues of race and crime in cities, creating a perfect political storm.\n\nBowman began attackingthe mayor and current administration for being soft on crime and posting about incidents of violent crime downtown. Pureval and the administration responded with videos and press conferences touting the city's efforts to combat crime and touting the city as safe. Crime statistics from the police show overall, crime has dropped across the city over the past three years. Still, property crimes in some areas, including Downtown, have risen.\n\nPureval has touted steps the city has taken, including a stronger curfew, more police recruitment classes, more drones and more visible police patrols.\n\n\"The long-term strategy is recruiting and retaining more police officers so that we have the manpower to increase our visibility throughout the city and also enforce the law,\" Pureval said. \"Those recruit classes are a really big part of that.\"\n\nBowman described a city administration he believes is tying the hands of officers and impeding their ability to apprehend criminals. If elected, he said he'd aim to hold weekly press conferences naming judges who release prisoners too early.\n\n\"Get the judges and the prosecutor to wake up and just say, 'Hey, we need to be a little bit harsher on what's going on in our city,\" Bowman said. \"This whole revolving door of criminals has to stop.\"\n\nTheetge placed on leave\n\nAfter a shooting on Fountain Square Oct. 13 in the heart of the city's downtown, political pressure continued to mount on Pureval's administration. City Manager Sheryl Long put Police Chief Teresa Theetge on paid leave and launched an internal investigation into the effectiveness of her leadership.\n\nPureval has maintained he has not pushed the city manager to take action against Theetge but said he supports the city manager's decision.\n\nBowman has toned down his rhetoric\n\nBowman came out of the gate with a spicy speech at his launch in March. He slammed the city's sanctuary status as an invitation for \"traffickers, cartels and criminals that can't go anywhere else.\" For anyone who inappropriately touches a child, he said, he'll have a \"Glock to nuts policy.\"\n\nSince then, he's omitted \"Glocks\" and \"nuts\" from his campaign speeches in favor of more traditional political fare about crime and other policy.\n\n\"I need you to understand the journey we've been on with this,\" Bowman told his supporters at a September fundraiser. \"Because for me, it wasn't like, 'Oh, here's some political ambitions that I've always had my whole life. Now is my start. No, it's all about impact.\"\n\nVance not involved in brother's campaign\n\nBeyond a post on X the day of the primary urging people to vote for his half-brother, the vice president hasn't been publicly involved in the race. Vance didn't vote in the primary and didn't donate to Bowman's campaign, according to records from the Board of Elections.\n\nBowman said that's true behind the scenes, too. When the pair talk, it's usually about 'Star Wars' and their children, he said.\n\n\"He'll ask how the campaign's doing, and I'll ask him how being vice president is, and it's usually a short talk,\" Bowman said. \"At the end of this, I would rather have a brother than a political advisor.\"\n\nTwo debates held\n\nBowman and Pureval have held two debates since the primary. The first debate on Oct. 9 got spicy. Pureval called Bowman and some of his followers \"MAGA extremists.\" Bowman didn't distance himself from Trump but said the race was about local issues.\n\nPrior to the debate, Pureval had criticized Bowman for not showing up at several high-profile forums Pureval attended.\n\nBowman, when asked by The Enquirer why he didn't show up to the forums, wouldn't say, and pointed the finger back at Pureval.\n\n\"There’s other events I’ve been to in the city he hasn’t attended as well,” Bowman said. Bowman wouldn't specify what those events were.\n\nBowman has a lot of supporters outside the city\n\nIt's not clear where Bowman will find the additional votes in the city to make up the huge gap from the primary. The Enquirer attended several campaign events where many Bowman supporters hailed from the more conservative, Trump-loving suburbs outside the city or elsewhere. A recent fundraiser sponsored by the late Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA featured speakers and people from outside the city, including roofer Garey Faulkner, a competitive beard champion and roofer from Amelia in Clermont County east of Cincinnati.\n\nAt the end of September, Bowman's church hosted a town hall with GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. While city supporters attended, many were like Henry Oberson, 57, of Loveland – a suburbanite who grew more interested in city politics after the street brawl video went viral.\n\nWhile he can't vote in the city election, Oberson said he likes Bowman.\n\n\"I think the momentum is building and changed and the campaign definitely has a very legitimate shot to win,\" Oberson said.\n\nWhat is Bowman's future?\n\nPolitical experts aren't so sure. If Bowman gets 40% of the vote, that would be a feat in an urban area, said Mariani, the Xavier political science professor. He might be able to parlay a strong showing into a congressional run, ala Wenstrup, or some other stab at higher office, Mariani said.\n\nBowman's chances of a better showing go up the lower the turnout, he said.\n\n\"If people don’t show up, you don’t need as many votes,\" Mariani said. \"It’s the longest of longshots.\"\n\nWho is Aftab Pureval?\n\nPureval, 43, a Democrat from Clifton, is running for his second term as mayor. Before winning the mayoral race in 2021, Pureval served as Hamilton County Clerk of Courts.\n\nHe sprang onto the political scene in 2016, unseating incumbent Republican Tracey Winkler for clerk of courts. After defeating a member of a prominent Republican political family, he rode that momentum to a congressional run in 2018 in which he lost to the incumbent Republican Rep. Steve Chabot.\n\nSince becoming mayor, he's garnered some national attention in Politico and the Los Angeles Times. He spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention. While rumors have flown around the city from time to time that Pureval is running for another office, he's always denied that.\n\nWho is Cory Bowman?\n\nBowman, 36, is pastor of The River Church in the West End and is a registered Republican. He also co-owns the Kings Arms Coffee, a West End coffee shop. He lives in College Hill. In a text to The Enquirer, he said he temporarily moved to the West End near his church this year but moved back to College Hill.\n\nBut it's Bowman's family that has drawn much of the attention. His half-brother is Vice President JD Vance.\n\nBowman has never run for office before. He said he's considered a role in local government as a way to give back to the city. Attending Vance and President Donald Trump's inauguration in January further inspired him to run, he told The Enquirer in February."

By early Tuesday afternoon, the death stood at 27, while another 956 people were injured, Public Health Ministry spokesperson Sharafat Zaman said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe tremor also damaged historical sites, including Afghanistan’s famed Blue Mosque in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, which is one of Afghanistan’s most revered religious landmarks, and the Bagh-e-Jahan Nama Palace in Khulm.\n\nThe Blue Mosque's minaret was badly damaged, while some bricks and tiles had fallen from some of the mosque's walls and cracks appeared in other parts of the centuries-old site, said Mahmoodullah Zarar, Head of Information and Culture of Balkh Province.\n\n“The Holy Shrine is a valuable monument of Islamic values ​​and the history of the Islamic era ...

Our women are facing great difficulties, we do not have a toilet and we do not have a place where our women can spend the night.”\n\nRescue crews were still operating in some areas on Tuesday, and were expected to finish by the end of the day.\n\nThe World Health Organization said partial damage had been reported in several health facilities, while the laboratory at the Samangan Provincial Hospital had collapsed, destroying critical medical equipment. Emergency response operations with health teams and rescue units were ongoing, it said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nImpoverished Afghanistan often faces difficulty in responding to natural disasters, especially in remote regions. Buildings tend to be low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and outlying areas made from mud bricks and wood, many poorly built.\n\nIn August, a quake in eastern Afghanistan killed more than 2,200 people."

        "content": "Hundreds of thousands rally in Manila against flood-control corruption scandal\n\ntoggle caption Mark Cristino/AP\n\nMANILA, Philippines — Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos gathered Sunday in the capital in the largest rally so far to demand accountability for a flood-control corruption scandal that has implicated powerful members of Congress and top government officials.\n\nVarious groups have protested in recent months following the discovery that thousands of flood defense projects across one of the world's most typhoon-prone countries were substandard, incomplete or simply did not exist.\n\nGovernment engineers, public works officials and construction company executives have testified under oath in hearings by the Senate and a fact-finding commission that members of Congress and officials at the Department of Public Works and Highways took kickbacks from construction companies to help them win lucrative contracts and avoid accountability. Most denied the allegations.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nInterior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said about 320,000 members of the Iglesia Ni Cristo, or Church of Christ, led the start of the three-day rally in Manila's Rizal Park, many wearing white and carrying anti-corruption placards. Hundreds, including retired generals, held a separate anti-corruption protest late Sunday at the \"People Power\" monument in suburban Quezon city.\n\nIglesia is an influential group that votes as a bloc and is courted by political candidates during elections.\n\nThe police, backed by the military, went on full alert and deployed thousands of personnel to secure the weekend rallies, although the government expects them to be peaceful, according to a confidential security assessment seen by The Associated Press.\n\nDuring a Sept. 21 anti-corruption demonstration, a few hundred black-clad protesters threw rocks, bottles and firebombs at police near the presidential palace in Manila, injuring more than 100 officers. Criminal complaints have been filed against 97 protesters.\n\ntoggle caption Mark Cristino/AP\n\nThe presidential palace went on security lockdown over the weekend, with major access roads barricaded by anti-riot police, cargo containers and barbed wires.\n\nNational police chief Lt. Gen. Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. ordered law enforcement to exercise \"maximum tolerance\" in Sunday's rallies.\n\nMarcos promises quick action as outrage over corruption grows\n\nFlood control is an especially sensitive issue in the Philippines, one of Asian countries most prone to deadly typhoons, flooding and extreme weather. Two typhoons left at least 259 dead this month, mostly from flash floods and landslides, and affected millions of others.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been trying to quell public outrage and street protests sparked by the scandal, saying on Thursday that many of the powerful senators, members of Congress and wealthy businesspeople who were implicated would be in jail by Christmas.\n\nMarcos said an independent fact-finding commission he created has already filed criminal complaints for graft and corruption and plunder against 37 suspects. Criminal complaints have also been filed against 86 construction company executives and nine government officials for allegedly evading nearly 9 billion pesos ($152 million) in taxes.\n\nAmong those accused are lawmakers opposed to and allied with Marcos, including former House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president's cousin and a key ally; and former Senate President Chiz Escudero. Both have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSen. Bong Go, a key ally of former President Rodrigo Duterte, has also been accused of involvement in corruption in flood control and other infrastructure projects. He has denied the allegations.\n\nDuterte, a harsh Marcos critic, was detained by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands in March for alleged crimes against humanity over his brutal anti-drugs crackdowns.\n\nHis daughter, the current vice president, said Marcos should also be held accountable and jailed for approving the 2025 national budget, which appropriated billions for flood control projects.\n\nThere have been isolated calls, including by some pro-Duterte supporters, for the military to withdraw support from Marcos, but Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. has repeatedly rejected those calls.\n\n\"With full conviction, I assure the public that the armed forces will not engage in any action that violates the Constitution,\" Brawner said. \"Not today, not tomorrow and certainly not under my watch.\""

        "content": "The incredible 252 mph peak wind gust measured in Hurricane Melissa as it approached Jamaica was verified this week.\n\nThat wind gust is now officially the highest wind speed ever recorded by the expendable instruments, called dropsondes, that are deployed into hurricanes, according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research at the National Science Foundation, where the instruments were developed.\n\nWhen Andy Hazelton, an associate scientist at the University of Miami, saw the data coming in from his spot aboard the NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft \"Kermit\" on Oct. 28, he could hardly believe his eyes. The wind reading was so high it was off the edge of the graph chart that displays the measurements.\n\n\"I knew it was a potentially historic observation,\" Hazelton told USA TODAY on Nov. 20. \"It was sobering to see it happen right near landfall.\"\n\nOther scientists watching the data flow in had similar reactions to the peak gust, a mix of awe at the power of nature and concern for the havoc it can wreak on people and their communities.\n\nAt least 90 deaths have been blamed on Hurricane Melissa, including 45 in Jamaica, where Melissa struck the island as a Category 5 hurricane on Oct. 28 with winds at the surface of more than 150 mph. Jamaican officials said this week Melissa caused at least $8.8 billion in damages. The storm also claimed lives in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n252 mph? Hurricane scientists see potential record in wind data\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration promptly contacted the atmospheric research center to ask them to confirm the measurement.\n\n\"NOAA looped us in when they saw the high wind speed and asked, 'Are these numbers any good?'\" said Holger Vömel, a senior scientist in the center's dropsonde program.\n\n\"They have pilots and researchers literally putting their lives on the line to get these measurements,\" Vömel stated in a news release. \"They’re the heroes, and it’s a privilege we get to play a role in making sure the measurements they acquire are accurate.\"\n\nThe center's staff ran the gust through a quality control program, checked that the numbers tracked with the laws of physics and typical hurricane behavior. With no gaps in reported measurements, and no other anomalies, the center confirmed the gust surpassed the previous dropsonde record gust of 248 mph, measured during Tyhpoon Megi over the Western Pacific in 2010.\n\nThe dropsondes, dropped through a chute in the hurricane hunter aircraft, gather data at levels that would be unsafe for the airplanes and their human passengers.\n\nThe crew aboard Kermit was deploying a fleet of instruments into the hurricane, where they dropped down through intense winds and rain, also streaming data on pressure, temperature and humidity back to the plane, where it could be transmitted to the hurricane center.\n\nThe 252-mph wind gust was recorded just before the dropsonde plunged into the Caribbean south of Jamaica on the morning of Oct. 28. Melissa, with peak sustained winds of 185 mph, was one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic.\n\nBut forecasters at the National Hurricane Center and the models they use \"need to know what is happening near sea level because that’s where people and property are most affected,\" said Terry Hock, an engineer who manages the dropsonde program at the foundation's atmospheric research center. \"The dropsonde gets you information you can’t get any other way and that’s why it’s been around for decades.\"\n\nThe scientists and engineers at NCAR works with other hurricane scientists to continue advancing the technology and tools to analyze the data the dropsondes collect.\n\nInto the eye of a hurricane: How NOAA uses drones penetrate monster storms\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, has written about hurricanes, tornadoes and violent weather for more than 30 years.

It was filed as Camp Mystic has drawn renewed outrage from several victims' families over plans to reopen the 100-year-old camp next summer.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAmong the claims in the lawsuit is that a groundskeeper was directed to spend more than an hour evacuating equipment while girls and counselors in cabins closest to the Guadalupe River were ordered to remain there, even as floodwaters overwhelmed the property.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by the families of five campers and the two counselors who died.\n\n\"These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,\" the lawsuit said. \"The camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins.\"\n\nThe suit also alleges the operators of the camp chose not to make plans to safely evacuate campers, despite state rules requiring such plans, and instead ordered campers and counselors to remain in their cabins as a matter of policy.\n\ntoggle caption Eli Hartman/AP\n\nDefendants named in the lawsuit include Camp Mystic, affiliated entities and its owners, including the estate of camp owner Richard Eastland, who also died in the flooding, and his family members.\n\nA separate lawsuit with similar allegations was filed Monday by the family of Eloise Peck, another Camp Mystic camper who died in the flood. Both lawsuits were filed in Travis County.\n\nTelephone and email messages left Monday with an attorney for Camp Mystic seeking comment on the lawsuit were not immediately returned.\n\nThe campers and counselors were killed when the fast-rising floodwaters roared through a low-lying area of the summer camp before dawn on the Fourth of July. All told, the destructive flooding killed at least 136 people, raising questions about how things went so terribly wrong.\n\nCounty leaders were asleep or out of town. The head of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather beforehand, but it's now unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesperson for the camp's operators said in the immediate aftermath.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe camp, established in 1926, did not evacuate and was hit hard when the river rose from 14 feet (4.2 meters) to 29.5 feet (9 meters) within 60 minutes.\n\nRyan DeWitt, whose daughter Molly DeWitt was one of the campers killed in the flooding, said in a statement that the lawsuit is a step toward helping the family find peace.\n\n\"We trust that through this process, light will be shed on what happened, and our hope is that justice will pave the way for prevention and much-needed safety reform,\" DeWitt said.\n\nThe deaths of the campers and counselors, and the gut-wrenching testimony from their parents to Texas lawmakers, led to a series of new laws designed to prevent similar tragedies in the future."

But police did not provide further details about the occupants of the plane and did not immediately return messages seeking more details.\n\nCoral Springs-Parkland Fire Department Deputy Chief Mike Moser said emergency crews responded within minutes of a call reporting the crash. Initially, no victims were located during rescue efforts and they shifted to a recovery operation. Moser said no homes were damaged, but crews spotted some debris near the retention pond. Local aerial televised footage showed a broken fence in the backyard of one home bordering the pond where the plane went down.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“There was no actual plane to be seen,” Moser said. “They followed the debris trail to the water.

He said the impact left debris scattered across his yard and that his pool and back porch were “contaminated” with spilled fuel.\n\nThe fuel smell was so strong inside his home that it took a few hours to dissipate, he added.\n\n“We heard the strangest sound. I never heard anything like it before, and apparently that was when this plane must have flown between my home and my neighbor’s house,” DeTrolio told the newspaper.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOfficials cautioned residents that police would maintain a significant presence in the area throughout Monday and Tuesday as investigators continue collecting evidence.\n\nBroward County, where the plane took off from and where the crash occurred, is home to a vibrant Caribbean American community that sprang into action to collect relief supplies following Hurricane Melissa. A powerful Category 5 hurricane, Melissa slammed into Jamaica late last month, leaving a path of destruction.\n\nMoser said police would take over recovery efforts, and federal aviation officials would investigate the cause of the crash.\n\nThe small Beechcraft King Air plane took off from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport at approximately 10:14 a.m., according to a spokesperson for the City of Fort Lauderdale, which owns and operates the airport. The crash occurred soon after takeoff, with Coral Springs police officers and firemen responding at 10:19 a.m., just five minutes later.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration records, the plane was manufactured in 1976. King Air models can seat between seven and 12 people, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.\n\nFederal records showed the registered owner of the plane is listed as International Air Services, a company that markets itself as specializing in providing trust agreements to non-U.S. citizens that enable them to register their aircraft with the FAA. A person who answered the company’s phone Monday afternoon declined to answer questions from a reporter, stating “no comment” and ending the phone call.\n\nThe flight tracking website FlightAware shows the plane made four other trips to or from Jamaica in the past week, traveling between George Town in the Cayman Islands and Montego Bay and Negril in Jamaica, before landing in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. It was not immediately clear who was organizing the trips.\n\nHurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on Oct. 28, tied for the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane in history. The storm also caused devastation in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic and prompted relief organizations to mobilize.\n\nLocal government officials in Jamaica said in the days after the storm that Melissa had ripped the roofs off 120,000 structures, affecting some 90,000 families in the island’s especially hard-hit western region. A week after Melissa's landfall in Jamaica, more than 2,000 people were still reported to be in shelters."

        "content": "Hurricane Melissa was already one of the most powerful hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean—and now scientists have confirmed a new way it neared superlative status.\n\nNewly released data show that Hurricane Melissa produced a wind gust of 252 miles per hour—just 1 mph shy of the fastest wind gust ever measured on Earth, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and 4 mph faster than the most powerful gust ever measured in a tropical cyclone at sea.\n\nThe previous record-holding storm, 2010’s Typhoon Megi, was located in the Pacific Ocean, where warmer waters typically permit the most powerful tropical cyclones to grow a little stronger than those in the Atlantic Ocean. “It’s actually quite amazing to see a sounding that breaks that record,” says Holger Vömel, an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who worked with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologists to verify the measurement was not the result of an instrument error.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n[Sign up for Today in Science, a free daily newsletter]\n\nLISTEN: Hurricane Melissa Was One of the Strongest Atlantic Storms Ever. Here’s Why\n\nHolger Vömel/NSF NCAR\n\nThere’s an important distinction between these powerful gusts—transient bursts of wind—and the sustained winds that dictate a storm’s ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale. This system of five categories is based on the strongest wind that lasts for one minute. Gusts do not need to persist and therefore can clock at much higher speeds than sustained winds can.\n\nHurricane Melissa’s sustained wind speeds reached a remarkable 185 mph, just 5 mph short of the Atlantic Ocean record. It achieved this monstrous strength because of its slow journey over abundant warm ocean waters.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nScientists measure wind speeds and other vital data from the top of the storm to the Earth’s surface with an instrument called a dropsonde, which was released from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft.\n\nVömel has helped examine previous potential record-breaking measurements. “I have a full understanding of all the gory details of how these measurements are taken,” he says. “I can look at it and see if there’s anything suspicious.” In one notable case, he helped show that an apparently record-breaking measurement from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was just an artifact of a malfunctioning instrument. But the observations from Hurricane Melissa checked out. “Everything behaved exactly as it was intended to,” he says.\n\nThe observation wasn’t quite high enough to shatter the current record for the fastest wind ever measured on Earth: 253 mph achieved by a 1996 tropical cyclone that hit Barrow Island in Australia. But Vömel says that’s not a fair comparison. The 1996 storm’s record was measured at 10 meters (33 feet) above the ground. The one from Hurricane Melissa was made 20 times higher up and over the ocean. Natural and artificial topography on land can channel wind in ways that speed it up—which is not the case inside a hurricane.*\n\nBesides these newly confirmed data, Hurricane Melissa was nearly record-setting in other ways: The storm reached a minimum central pressure of 892 millibars—making it tied for the third strongest hurricane on record in the Atlantic. And its sustained wind speeds tied it for second place in the Atlantic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHurricane Melissa also broke records in its devastation: it was the strongest storm to ever make landfall in Jamaica, and it caused the second-highest recorded rainfall in the nation since 2000.\n\n“These storms must be taken seriously,” Vömel says. “This is a record-breaking sounding, and it’s really amazing that we can observe that. But there’s also people on the ground who suffered through that.”\n\n*Editor’s Note (11/21/25): This paragraph was edited after posting to correct the height at which the 1996 storm’s record was measured."

Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nChina has ramped up its weapons development programs to a breathtaking degree, introducing waves of new missiles, ground combat systems, and vessels, as well as vastly expanding its nuclear triad. In just the past few months alone, China showed off gobs of new hardware, especially during its Victory Day parade in September. But above all else, Beijing’s developments in the air combat arena have been most stunning to observe. Autonomous combat drones, from relatively small to extremely large, and everything in between, to the emergence of tailless J-XDS and J-36 tactical jets, and ever sub-variations of them, as well as flying a stealth fighter from its new carrier, are among the revelations piling up at an increasing pace.\n\nThe status of these weapons programs and how many are real or merely meant to confuse and overwhelm foreign intelligence isn’t clear, but based on historic precedent, the notion that many are decoys isn’t supported. With so much development emerging publicly, and so much more going on clandestinely, along with other developments around an increasingly troubled globe, including from an active war in Ukraine, a critical question must be raised: Is the American intelligence apparatus able to deal with so much foreign technological change at one time?\n\nNot since the height of the Cold War have so many military advancements and individual adversary weapons programs flooded the space. Does the U.S. intelligence community have the raw capacity to adequately deal with this now and sustain it for the foreseeable future?\n\nShenyang Aircraft Corporation’s (SAC) J-XDS, also referred to unofficially as the J-50. (Via X)\n\nWith the Defense Intelligence Agency declining to comment and the CIA not responding to our queries, we reached out to a number of experts in the field to get their sense of how the U.S. intelligence community (USIC) is able to process and track this growing wave of weapons programs and provide adequate analysis for the White House, Pentagon and Congress. The responses we received vary quite dramatically. This is step one in trying to get a clear answer to this glaring question. We will be following up with more on the topic in the future.\n\nThe answers to our question from our experts have been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nTimothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at RAND Corporation:\n\n“China’s largest and growing inventory of modern weapons does pose a challenge to U.S. intelligence collection efforts. U.S. intelligence capabilities are quite sophisticated and can collect considerable data on systems once they are deployed. However, it is more useful to anticipate future weapons or programs in development and this is probably much more difficult for U.S. intelligence to accurately determine due to the secretive nature of Chinese weapons programs. Thus, U.S. intelligence is at some risk of being surprised by the emergence of new weapons systems.\n\nSome types or programs are easier to monitor and predict than others. Warships, for example, are hard to hide and only built in a few locations. This makes it easier for U.S. intelligence to monitor. Missiles, directed energy, and hi-tech systems are smaller and easier to hide, which makes it harder for U.S. intelligence to collect.\n\nPerhaps even more challenging than intelligence collection is the problem of how to counter the weapons. Chinese technology has improved considerably and many of their weapons and equipment systems lag only that of the United States. These are sophisticated and deadly systems and could pose a serious challenge to U.S. military forces on the battlefield. Developing counters to weapons such as hypersonic anti-ship missiles, advanced surface-to-air missiles, and stealth aircraft all require enormous sums of money and new technology. Even still, it is unclear if the U.S. can effectively counter some of these new systems, which raise questions about the ability of U.S. military forces to survive and fight in a conflict near China’s coast.”\n\nA possible first sighting of China’s next-generation aircraft carrier, generally referred to as the Type 004. Construction work at a shipyard in Dalian, in China’s Liaoning province, reveals a module that is consistent with an aircraft carrier — which would be China’s fourth — although there remain many questions about the precise nature of the object. (Google Earth) Google Earth\n\nBrad Bowman, senior director at Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Center on Military & Political Power:\n\n“Beijing revealed a remarkable quantity of weapons in the parade back in September. It is vital that the United States Intelligence Community and the Pentagon understand the capabilities of the systems displayed, distinguishing between systems that are hyped versus those that represent real advancements in capability. That is easier said than done and takes time and serious expertise to accomplish accurately. The importance and difficulty of this task is another reason why we need a large, effective, and well-funded intelligence community to understand our adversaries, their intentions, and their military capabilities – so decision makers can make informed decisions on how to respond.\n\nA CS-5000T drone is reviewed during the V-Day military at Tiananmen Square on September 3, 2025, in Beijing, China. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images) VCG\n\nI am all for efficiency in government, but the effectiveness of our intelligence community is a higher priority than efficiency, particularly in this dangerous geo-strategic moment for Americans.\n\nIt is possible that Beijing is happy to inundate the U.S. intelligence community with an enormous quantity of systems and munitions to scrutinize. But a more prudent approach in Washington is to assume that Beijing actually means what it says and is sprinting to develop and field military capabilities that it hopes could conquer Taiwan and defeat the U.S. military in the Pacific.\n\nIf Beijing is trying to portray more advanced military capabilities than it actually possesses, it would not be the first country to do so. Then again, we have also seen examples in which Americans were unwisely dismissive of adversary capabilities. We should neither exaggerate nor dismiss what we are seeing from China. We should try to understand the actual capabilities of each system, and then realize that those capabilities can change quickly.\n\nThe satellite image that was the first public evidence of the ‘GJ-X’ large cranked-kite stealth drone aircraft existing showed it on the runway at China’s test base near Malan.

Washington is no doubt on the short list of intended audiences, but Beijing is also sending messages to America’s partners, to the Chinese people, and to the PRC’s partners, including the other members of the axis of aggressors – Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\nRegardless, the split screen between a historic expansion in military capabilities in China and a government shutdown in America could not be more jarring and troubling.”\n\nZack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, where he studies U.S. strategy in Asia, including alliance dynamics and U.S.-China competition:\n\n“I think the United States is certainly concerned about some of the new systems shown by Beijing, but many experts have expected China to continue developing more advanced uncrewed systems and long-range missiles, so I wouldn’t say that those are huge surprises.\n\nThe United States has a number of intelligence agencies with deep expertise on weapons systems, so although I’m sure they are busy watching these new developments, I doubt that they are overwhelmed. At the end of the day, we’re really only talking about a handful of truly new systems, so the magnitude of the challenge is probably workable, even if it does require a substantial amount of time and attention at DIA and elsewhere.\n\nChinese DF-5C intercontinental ballistic missile systems pass through Tiananmen Square during a military parade in Beijing, capital of China, Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Yan Linyun/Xinhua via Getty Images) Xinhua News Agency\n\nChristopher Miller, former acting defense secretary from November 2020 to January 2021 during the first Trump administration:\n\n“I don’t think there was concern about the ability to track and analyze Chinese weapons programs. It was a pretty standard collection requirement. Now, how effective they were ……I don’t know how effective they were. I am out of the business now.\n\nThe large number of programs was not a concern. It was a pretty standard collection requirement. The challenge was prioritization because of so many different constituencies pushing their ‘pet rocks.’ But that is simply part of the churn. It was never a crisis issue — just typical process.\n\nQuestions about being adequately resourced was the standard pathology of the IC — ‘they NEVER have enough resources’; the political masters don’t understand the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF)!! ‘Woe is us; etc.’ It was/is their SOP.”\n\nRobert Peters, senior research fellow for strategic deterrence in the Allison Center for National Security:\n\n“How overwhelming, or not, for the USIC are Chinese new weaponry like those seen so far in parade preps and programs, like the long-range bombers, UAVs etc? They are a problem, both the quantity and diversity of systems displayed, but we should not make the Chinese out to be 10 feet tall. It is unclear how many of these systems are real vs. how many are mockups. And even if they are all real, it is unclear how effective these systems are.\n\nAs an example, the U.S. Air Force recently said that the Chinese ‘stealth bomber’ — which looks for all the world like a B-2 Stealth bomber— has no stealth characteristics at all, it simply looks like a stealth bomber.\n\nThe future Chinese H-20 stealth bomber. (PLAAF/YouTube Screencap)\n\nFurther, even if these systems are highly capable, it is unclear how or how well the PLA would employ them. The PLA has not fought in a kinetic conflict since 1979, so they have no real-world experience in combat operations. While they certainly exercise jointly, exercises are far different than battlefield effectiveness. So we should look at what the Chinese are producing with seriousness, but we should not be fatalistic about them.\n\nIs this affecting the USIC and the military’s ability to get a handle on this? The Chinese military buildup — particularly is numbers of fifth-generation fighters, naval surface combatants, missiles, and nuclear warheads — presents a real challenge for the United States, yes.\n\nThe quantity they are able to produce, coupled with their ability to focus their combat power on a specific theater close to home, is the challenge for us. Even if you believe that U.S. military capabilities are qualitatively superior to Chinese capabilities (which, I do believe), the U.S. is a global power. It has aircraft carrier strike groups operating in the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea, and the Pacific. It has ground and air forces deployed on six continents. This is because the United States has global commitments. China is able to field an enormous quantity of combat power on the Western Pacific, focus it, and achieve results, even with a qualitatively inferior force, while the U.S. would be pulling forces from around the world during a contingency.\n\nIt will require a significant amount of analysts to track and analyze these forces, but I think we have the manpower to make it happen.”\n\nOnce again, this is our first look into this unique facet of the growing military technology race between the U.S. and China. Stay tuned for follow-ups.\n\nContact the author: howard@thewarzone.com"

I do not know where to go, but I hope there is some safe shelter where I can take my family,” she told the AFP news agency.\n\nAs floodwaters receded in Manampitiya, 250km (155 miles) northeast of Colombo, the scale of destruction became visible.\n\n“Manampitiya is a flood-prone town, but I have never seen such a volume of water,” said 72-year-old resident S Sivanandan, who described extensive damage to businesses and property.\n\nThe disaster has created urgent medical needs, with blood supplies critically low. Lakshman Edirisinghe, the blood bank chief, reported receiving only 236 units on Saturday against a daily requirement of 1,500. “Because of floods and heavy rains, we were unable to conduct our mobile campaigns to collect blood,” he said, urging donors to visit blood banks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials warn of continuing landslide risks as mountain slopes remain saturated with rainwater.\n\nPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake declared a state of emergency on Saturday and appealed for international assistance. India responded immediately with relief supplies and rescue helicopters, while Pakistan and Japan have also pledged support.\n\nThe cyclone has destroyed more than 25,000 homes, forcing 147,000 people into temporary shelters, with another 968,000 requiring assistance after being displaced. Military personnel are working alongside civilian responders in the huge relief effort.\n\nThis marks Sri Lanka’s deadliest natural disaster since 2017, when floods and landslides killed more than 200 people. The country’s worst flooding this century occurred in June 2003, killing 254 people."
