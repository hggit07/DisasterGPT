        "content": "The Seattle Seahawks will face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 60 after claiming a thrilling victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.\n\nThe NFC Championship game was a shootout in Seattle, with Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold and Rams counterpart Matt Stafford both throwing three touchdown passes before the hosts held on for a 31-27 win.\n\nMeanwhile, defences dominated the AFC Championship game as the Patriots ground out a 10-7 win in a blizzard at the Denver Broncos.\n\nQuarterback Drake Maye, Stafford's main rival for this season's Most Valuable Player award, ran in New England's only touchdown as they secured a record-extending 12th Super Bowl appearance and their first since Tom Brady led the franchise to its sixth NFL championship in 2019.\n\nThis year's NFL title decider will be a rematch of 2015, when the Patriots beat the Seahawks 28-24 to deny them back-to-back Super Bowl wins.\n\nThis is the fourth time Seattle have reached the NFL showpiece, with their solitary championship coming in 2014.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 takes places on Sunday, 8 February in Santa Clara, California, at the home of the San Francisco 49ers."

        "content": "The focus of Wednesday's wet weather will be across the northern half of England and once again for Scotland.\n\nWhile a further 40-60mm of rain may fall across eastern Scotland, precipitation there will increasingly turn to snow.\n\nFurther south on Wednesday, rainfall will be more showery in nature with the chance of some brighter and drier spells developing.\n\nFor Thursday and Friday, colder and drier conditions are expected to develop from the north, slowly filtering south.\n\nA yellow Met Office warning covering a large part of central and eastern Scotland will remain in place throughout Tuesday until 23:59 on Wednesday.\n\nA warning covering parts of Argyll and Bute will come into effect on Wednesday at midnight, also due to expire at 23:59. Both warnings mean flooding and some transport disruption is likely.\n\nThis region has been exceptionally wet so far this February.\n\nWith 376mm of rainfall recorded, Aboyne in Aberdeenshire will soon surpass half its annual rainfall.\n\nFurther south, Worcestershire and the Isle of Wight have experienced around their February average rainfall in just the first week of the month.\n\nThis additional rainfall comes after very wet weather throughout January.\n\nThe Environment Agency (EA) estimates that 300 properties have already been flooded and around 16,000 properties have been protected by flood defences.\n\nEA flood duty manager Andy Hitchings said: \"As well as significant groundwater flooding remaining likely in parts of Dorset and Wiltshire, there are risks of significant river flooding impacts on the Somerset Levels, with minor river flooding impacts expected in parts of the East Midlands and probable in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire.\""
