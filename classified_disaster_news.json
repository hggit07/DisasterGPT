        "content": "Dozens dead in 'total devastation' left behind by Hurricane Melissa\n\n30 October 2025 Share Save Share Save\n\nGabriela Pomeroy and Nardine Saad\n\nHurricane Melissa floods and destroys towns across Caribbean including in Cuba, Jamaica and Haiti (pictured)\n\nHurricane Melissa has continued its devastating sweep across the Caribbean, destroying homes and infrastructure, flooding neighbourhoods and leaving dozens dead. The impact in Jamaica was clearer on Wednesday, after the island nation was hit squarely by the category five storm - one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the region. At least five people have been confirmed dead there. At least another 20 died during flooding in Haiti as Melissa, now a category two storm, tore through the region. In Jamaica, people remain stranded on roofs and without power. Prime Minister Andrew Holness noted the \"total devastation\" across the island-nation.\n\nHe added that \"80-90% of roofs were destroyed\", along with hospitals, libraries, police stations, port houses and other urban infrastructure. King Charles, who is the head of state in Jamaica, said in a statement that he was \"deeply concerned\" and \"profoundly saddened\" at the damage caused by Melissa in Jamaica and across the Caribbean. \"This most dreadful of record-breaking storms reminds us of the increasingly urgent need to restore the balance and harmony of Nature for the sake of all those whose lives and livelihoods may have been shattered by this heartbreaking disaster,\" he said.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Hurricane Melissa caused flooding and damage to buildings in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba\n\nFrom Jamaica, where the storm also caused mudslides, and palm trees to be tossed like toothpicks, Melissa moved north to Cuba as a category three storm, bringing 115 mph winds and heavy rain, and battering the south-east of the island. How do hurricanes form and are they getting stronger?\n\nWhat makes Melissa such a dangerous storm?\n\n'We are all terrified', say locals in path of Hurricane Melissa Rovier Mesa Rodríguez, a video maker who lives in Santiago de Cuba, called the storm \"terrifying\" and described it sounding \"like a tornado\". Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel asked residents to \"not let their guard down\" and said that the country had prepared for a worst-case scenario, which helped its response. On Wednesday night, the storm was 105 miles (170km) from the central Bahamas and expected to reach the Bahamas region overnight. Hurricane Melissa was moving north-east with wind speeds at 100 mph (155 km/h). A dangerous storm surge is expected there before it moves further north toward Bermuda. A tropical storm warning is in place for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the speed of the slow-moving hurricane is expected to increase in the coming days.\n\nHurricane Melissa - what we know about the damage in Jamaica\n\nIn Jamaica, three men and a woman were confirmed dead. They were discovered after being washed up by the flood waters in the storm, said Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica's minister of Local Government and Community Development. About three-quarters of the country lost electricity overnight. Richard Vernon, mayor of Montego Bay, told the BBC that half of the city had been cut off from the other by floods. He said the priority was to \"check if everybody is alive\". A resident in St Elizabeth sheltering in her four-bedroom home described the moment her roof blew off. Gordon Swaby, a businessman in Kingston, told the BBC that his first cousin's house was completely destroyed. His cousin - who he declined to be named - recently moved from the United States to her \"dream\" house by the sea in the upscale Crane Road area. She lost the entire concrete structure and everything in it. \"She wanted a different kind of life,\" Gordon said. \"She chose the area because she loves the sea, so this is really devastating.\" Devastation was evident on Wednesday across central Jamaica. The city of Mandeville was flattened and the main road through town was littered with debris. Foliage was stuck to everything, and bits of building material were scattered along the road. The clean-up is expected to take months. Pia Chevallier, who is on holiday in Jamaica, said she felt \"sick with worry\" during the storm overnight. \"The windows didn't stop vibrating.\"\n\nWatch: Strong winds and flying debris as Hurricane Melissa makes landfall in Jamaica"

        "content": "Before and after: Satellite images reveal hurricane devastation in Jamaica\n\n30 October 2025 Share Save Nick Beake, BBC Verify USA Correspondent and Thomas Copeland, BBC Verify Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nWith power down, problems with communications and navigating parts of the island treacherous, the authorities in Jamaica have not yet been able to give a detailed assessment of the damage inflicted by Hurricane Melissa. But the devastating impact of the Category 5 storm on communities is starting to be revealed by satellite imagery. BBC Verify has been examining the new images to try to piece together what has been destroyed and what has been left standing.\n\nBlack River\n\nArguably the most striking impact can be seen in images of the southwestern coastal port of Black River. We can identify specific buildings that have been battered or in some cases destroyed. By comparing a satellite image taken on 9 February with one taken on 29 October - after the hurricane hit - you can see that the distinctive white roof of a building housing a market has been replaced by a gaping hole. A little further north, a café has been wiped off the map. At the top of the image, the red roof of a warehouse has disappeared. The outline of the fire station next to the market is still visible but the top of the building appears to have been torn off. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has described Black River as \"ground zero\" after sharing footage of the destruction there.\n\nWhite House\n\nPhotographs of White House, a fishing village on the west coast of Jamaica which is home to several thousand people, reveal how it bore the brunt as Melissa made landfall with winds of up to 185 mph.\n\nNearly every structure appears to have been damaged or destroyed. In particular, the buildings next to the beach appear to have razed to the ground. These include restaurants called Marva's and Pelican Lookout. The top of a large circular structure is now missing and further inland, along the main road, a cluster of shops has been hit hard. Fishing boats in the bay - seen in satellite imagery on 7 October - have disappeared.\n\nMontego Bay"

At least 51 people were killed and approximately 400,000 displaced.\n\nWith communities still reeling from the natural disaster, the last thing the people of Punjab are doing is acting like a victim, says Jaskaran Sandhu, an Indo-Canadian civil lawyer who is also on the board of the World Sikh Organization (WSO), the predominant religion of the northwestern Indian state.\n\n“The destruction and the death toll was significantly mitigated by grassroots forces,” he tells Yahoo Canada from his law office in Calgary. “There has also been humanitarian aid and support from the diaspora in Canada and around the world.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile critics have slammed the Indian government for slow — or lack thereof — responses to the disaster, Canadian Sikhs have helped raise millions to help rebuild amid the historic flood across Punjab province.\n\nIndian army personnel rescue flood-affected residents and their dog on a boat across the engorged Beas river at Baoopur village in Kapurthala district in India's Punjab state on August 30, 2025.

(Photo by Shammi MEHRA / AFP) (Photo by SHAMMI MEHRA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nLawyer and community journalist: 'Floods should radicalize Punjab'\n\nSandhu, also a community journalist and co-founder of Baaz News, a media outlet covering issues of the Sikh and Punjabi diaspora, wrote an article, entitled “The Floods Should Radicalize Punjab: Punjab cannot keep sacrificing itself for an ungrateful country,” in which he called out Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s lack of response to the crisis for weeks.\n\n“It was left to Sikh institutions, Gurdwaras (Sikh temples), and ordinary Punjabis to mobilize,” he wrote. “Once again, we have been forced to save ourselves while the world’s so-called largest democracy look[ed] away.”\n\nDespite a lack of initiative from the government, Punjab did not succumb to a victimhood mentality, he continued. “There has been no looting, no violence, no collapse of social trust … This is a high-trust society in action.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat irked many Punjabis — in Punjab and around the world — was how Modi was quick to post about the earthquakes in Afghanistan to his social media channels at the beginning of September. The sentiment for a foreign country’s natural disaster woes before his own sparked many to call out his apparent lack of care and concern for Punjab.\n\n“What about Punjab? Punjab is flooded. Not a single word for Punjab. People are losing lives, houses, fields, livestock,” responded one X user.\n\nPunjabis' perception is that 'government is distant and uncaring about them as a people'\n\nBut why was the response so slow for a crisis in the state of his own country?\n\n“Modi and the BJP government [Bharat Janata Party — the country’s Hindu nationalist political party] are not the type to stay silent on things,” Sandhu says. “As Punjab is battered by the worst flood in decades — and which have brought about an unprecedented level of damage — it lends itself to the very real perception by Punjabis that the central government is distant and uncaring about them as a people.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPunjab has a long history of feeling like a second-class state in its own country.\n\nThe region feels like it ranks last for a number of reasons: Being a national minority is one of them.\n\n“It’s one of only four states that doesn’t have a Hindu majority,” Sandhu says. “Punjab also has a history of voting against the BJP, so there’s no incentive for the central government to care about us.”\n\nBut when the need is reversed, like when there is a conflict between India and Pakistan, Punjab, as a border state to Pakistan, has to suffer decisions it has no control over. Many Punjabis feel that it makes no sense to continue to sacrifice themselves for an ungrateful government.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis disillusionment with Delhi, India’s capital, has often incited separatist notions. For this reason, “India treats Punjab like an existential threat that needs to be constantly stamped out.”\n\nThere is also distrust in the state government. “Bhagwant Mann has been inept at addressing and working on resolving the destruction that has taken place since the floods,” Sandhu says, referring to Punjab’s chief minister (equivalent to a Canadian province's premier).\n\n“Their drive right now is to ask for donations for state coffers so that they can provide humanitarian support and rebuilding efforts. But the community’s response has been, ‘We’re already going through grassroots organizations and have been mobilizing ourselves and getting donations directly through Sikh aid organizations and temples, so why would we need to wait on you?’ The criticism is that the state government hasn’t really done anything to advocate for Punjab.”\n\nFrom bad to worse: 'Central government has played a big role in the floods'\n\nOf course, it could be because the state government is beholden to the Modi government. But there is also a bigger picture issue at play as to why the PM was particularly silent about the floods, at least in the beginning, Sandhu believes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“The central government has played a big role in the floods,” he says. The nature in which Punjab’s dams and canals are being managed is a major problem. “Heavy rainfall is one thing, but the way in which the water has been released out of the dam was optimized for the maximum amount of damage. The water was released in a way that made it very difficult — impossible even — to manage the outflow.”\n\nSandhu says to make matters worse, the canal that feeds Punjab’s waters to neighbouring states like Rajasthan, were shut as well. “So those floodwaters didn’t have anywhere to escape; it just pooled in Punjab. The frustration for Punjab is ‘You’ve built these canals where you extract water, depleting Punjab’s water tables and the riparian rights, and you refuse to negotiate and work with Punjab on the main sticking point.” That point involves water rights in Punjab and drier states like Rajasthan trying to extract water with the help of the central government.\n\n“But when there’s a flood and we need to mitigate floodwaters, everyone shuts those canals down. In good times you’re extracting water, and in bad times you’re shutting those canals down so that there’s no outflow.”\n\nSandhu thinks that’s the bigger problem here. “The central government has mismanaged the water release of the dams and they’ve mismanaged canal operations. This is a natural disaster that the government has an immense role in manufacturing — whether by incompetence or a lack of care.” Modi and the BJP are unable to address that legitimate critique in any meaningful way, he continues. “So they have chosen silence.”\n\nAid from government nowhere near enough\n\nOn Sept. 9, the prime minister did a flyover of Punjab to conduct an aerial survey to assess the damage. He also visited the city of Gurdaspur to interact with flood victims. The central government also announced 1,600 Crore in financial aid, but critics say it’s nowhere near enough to compensate for damages and rebuild.\n\nThe central government has mismanaged the water release of the dams and they’ve mismanaged canal operations.\n\nThe immediate, most pressing concern for Punjabis continues to be solving the problems at hand, says Sandhu. “It’s repairing infrastructure that is water-bogged; it’s fixing tractors and getting equipment so that farmers can tend to the fields again. It’s also removing sand silt that got washed onto agricultural land, making it difficult to cultivate. And of course, it’s getting homes livable again.”\n\nSikhs in Canada respond: 'The real story is a community story'\n\nThe reaction from Sikhs in Canada as well as around the world has been to immediately raise funds and support everyone back home. “Sikhs in Canada are very well-connected to Punjab: We all have family and friends and sometimes even land back home,” Sandhu says. “Punjabi-Canadian radio stations have raised millions for example, as have Gurdwaras [Sikh temples].”\n\nSikhs in Canada are very well-connected to Punjab: We all have family and friends and sometimes even land back home.\n\nREDFM, Canada’s largest South Asian media network with radio stations in Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary, ran a live on-air radiothon this past September to help raise funds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“It started early in the morning and went well into the evening — about 12 hours of continuous broadcasting,” says program director Pooja Sekhon. “Throughout the day, we had hosts sharing stories, and volunteers were taking live calls from people making donations. It was emotional, energetic, and really moving to see the momentum building as the day went on.”\n\nThe result: $2.2 million were raised as a coordinated effort across the three cities.\n\n“Each city brought its own energy, its own set of callers, and local businesses who got involved,” Sekhon adds. The funds have been directed to SAF International, a registered Canadian charitable organization that works closely with partner organizations in Punjab.\n\n“Together, they’ll be collaborating on rebuilding efforts in the affected communities.”\n\nSandhu believes that what we have witnessed in the aftermath of the Punjab floods is a deep reflection of how much Punjabis do right as a community.\n\n“The real story is a community story.”"

        "content": "Hurricane Melissa: Jamaica braces for world's strongest storm of 2025\n\n28 October 2025 Share Save Vanessa Buschschlüter and Jaroslav Lukiv Share Save\n\nWatch: Storm chasers fly inside the eye of Hurricane Melissa\n\nThree people have already died in Jamaica as it braces for the world's strongest storm this year - and possibly the strongest on record for the island - with US meteorologists warning of \"catastrophic and life-threatening\" conditions. With wind speeds of up to 175mph (282km/h), Hurricane Melissa is a category five storm - the maximum strength. It is intensifying and expected to make landfall on the Caribbean island early on Tuesday. It has been blamed for four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, in addition to the lives lost in Jamaica. Experts warn that Melissa's slow pace may mean prolonged torrential rain in some areas, increasing the risk of deadly flooding and landslides.\n\nFollow live updates The latest data from the US-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) shows that in terms of maximum wind and low central pressure, Melissa is the world's strongest storm so far this year. At its current strength, it would be the strongest hurricane to hit Jamaica since record-keeping began in 1851, CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reported. Tropical storm conditions are already occurring in Jamaica, and \"catastrophic and life-threatening hurricane-force wind conditions are expected to begin Tuesday morning,\" the latest NHC public advisory update said at 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT) on Monday.\n\nWatch: Satellite video shows Hurricane Melissa intensifying near Jamaica\n\nThree \"storm-related deaths\" were already reported in Jamaica Monday evening ahead of the hurricane's landfall, Jamaica's ministry of health and wellness said on X. The NHC said Melissa was currently about 140 miles (240km) south-west of the capital Kingston, with sustained winds of 175mph, (280km/h). It was moving \"north-northeast\" at 2mph (4 km/h). The update warned that within the eyewall - the inner part of the hurricane next to the eye, where wind speeds are typically the highest - \"total structural failure is likely\". It urged extra caution in Jamaica's \"higher elevation areas\", where wind speeds could be as much as 30% stronger. NHC director Michael Brennan warned Jamaicans: \"Do not venture outside with catastrophic life threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides expected through Tuesday.\" He advised not to \"go out in the eye as it passes over your area. The forward speed of Melissa is going to increase and the eye is going to start to move very quickly across the island.\" Forty inches of rain (100cm) was possible in parts of Jamaica over the next four days, according to the NHC. \"This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,\" said NHC deputy director Jamie Rhome. The Jamaican government has ordered evacuations for parts of Kingston. In a BBC interview, Jamaican Education Minister Dana Morris Dixon warned of an impending storm \"the likes of which we have never seen\". \"We've been having rain all of October. So the ground is already very saturated. And then to take that much rain means we're going to have flooding, extensive flooding and landslides in the mountainous areas,\" she told BBC Newshour. The minister added: \"We have 881 shelters. We have activated all our shelters. All of them are free.'' A Hurricane Hunter aircraft, which collects data in severe storms and informs forecasts on the pathway and intensity of hurricanes, was forced to abort a mission after experiencing severe turbulence, a spokesperson for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told CBS. Evadney Campbell, a Londoner currently visiting family on Jamaica's north coast, told the BBC: \"The house that I am in is hurricane proof. It is built with blocks and steel from top to bottom and is filled with concrete. \"We're checking on neighbours to see if they are OK. \"I am worried about people who live on the lowlands in parts of the south-east. Many do not want to leave their homes as they are worried about looting their houses,\" Ms Campbell said. Damian Anderson, a 47-year-old teacher from the mountainous town of Hagley Gap in the south-east, said impassable roads already had cut off his community. \"We can't move. We're scared,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.\n\nWatch: Jamaicans and Cubans prepare for Hurricane Melissa\n\nJamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has ordered the immediate evacuation of several vulnerable communities across the island. In a post on X, he urged \"every Jamaican to prepare, stay indoors during the storm, and comply with evacuation orders\". \"We will weather this storm and rebuild stronger,\" he wrote. \"You have been warned. It's now up to you to use that information to make the right decision,\" he said during a briefing, and told CNN, \"I don't believe there is any infrastructure within this region that could withstand a Category 5 storm, so there could be significant dislocation.\" In some rural areas, school buses were used to ferry vulnerable people to shelters and across the country.\n\nLater on Tuesday night, hurricane conditions are expected in Cuba, as well as tropical storm conditions in Haiti, according to the NHS report. The Bahamas will experience hurricane conditions on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions in the Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday. At least three people are already known to have died and hundreds of homes have been flooded in Haiti as Melissa brought torrential rainfall to the island of Hispaniola. In the Dominican Republic, located on the eastern side of Hispaniola, one person also died. Local media identified the victim as a 79-year-old man who had been swept away by floodwaters in the capital, Santo Domingo. A 13-year-old has also been reported missing after being dragged away by strong currents as he was swimming in the sea. Several people were rescued after being trapped in their cars by the rising floodwater.\n\nOrlando Barría/EPA/Shutterstock Heavy rains brought by Hurricane Melissa flooded neighbourhoods in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic"

        "content": "The Pacific Northwest is being taken for a ride, and a major earthquake off the coast of Oregon this week was the latest jolt reminding residents just how fragile the region’s future really is.\n\nThe 4.2 magnitude quake struck nearly 200 miles from the coastal town of Barview. It was the third such seismic event in the area in the last two weeks, part of a swarm that scientists say could signal an upcoming eruption of Axial Seamount, an underwater shield volcano that last erupted in 2015.\n\n\"There's still a chance it could erupt by the end of the year. We don't really know exactly when it will happen, but nothing seems imminent since the number of earthquakes per day is relatively low,\" Bill Chadwick a researcher at Oregon State University, told the Daily Mail.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut the quake swarm is only the surface-level warning. The real threat comes from the much larger system grinding beneath the region: The Cascadia Subduction Zone—a 700-mile fault that runs all the way from California to British Columbia—where two giant tectonic plates are locked in a high-stakes standoff. The North American plate is slowly crushing the Juan de Fuca plate beneath it, according to experts, lifting the region millimeter by millimeter over centuries. But that pressure won’t build forever.\n\nWhen the plates finally slip, they’ll unleash what scientists call a megathrust earthquake, or “the great quake” in layman's terms. This magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake will be capable of violently shaking the region for minutes and triggering a massive tsunami.\n\nBut there’s another, less visible threat that could have longer-lasting consequences: subsidence, or the sinking of land. In a matter of minutes, entire coastal communities could drop by up to 6 feet, permanently redrawing the floodplain and placing thousands of homes and lives at risk.\n\nNew research shows subsidence following the great quake could double, or even triple, the number of people and properties exposed to catastrophic flooding—an impact that most flood maps and insurance models still fail to capture.\n\nWhat is subsidence (and why it matters more than you think)?\n\nMake your hands into fists and press them hard against each other. Now, tilt one fist upward, like it’s riding over the other. When the pressure becomes too much, one fist suddenly slips past the other and, in an instant, drops.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNow, imagine your fists are the Earth’s crust. That drop is called subsidence.\n\n“During one of these over magnitude 8, probably up to magnitude 9 earthquakes, the land actually deforms and drops down up to 6 feet or 2 meters,” explains Tina Dura, a coastal geologist and lead researcher on a new study examining flood exposure in the Pacific Northwest recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“Basically causing sea level rise of 6 feet within minutes.”\n\nThis instant ground-level drop doesn’t just mean higher tides. It redefines the baseline for future flooding. Areas that were once safely above water could suddenly become permanent flood zones, or even become permanently under water—changing the region’s coastline, increasing insurance costs, and putting thousands of homes at risk.\n\nWhat happens to coastal communities when the ground drops\n\nThe last time a megathrust earthquake rocked the Pacific Northwest was centuries ago, long before cities, suburbs, and infrastructure blanketed the region’s coast. But scientists like Dura are looking to the geologic record to understand what the quake left behind, and what could happen when the next one strikes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Cascadia has repeatedly dropped down up to 6 feet in these earthquakes,” she explains. “We find these marsh soils that are overlain by really clean gray tidal mud, showing that these wetlands dropped down and were converted to tidal flats repeatedly.”\n\nIn other words, when the ground sank, the ocean rushed in, flooding areas that were once comfortably above water.\n\n“On the coastal records, we can look back about 7,000 years or so, and [we’re] seeing these catastrophic changes in these estuaries,” she adds. “I'm constantly thinking about the land level change that's going to occur.”\n\n\n\nThat land level change is what makes subsidence so dangerous. What was once safe, dry ground could become a flood-prone tidal flat in a matter of minutes. And while the region once held quiet wetlands, it’s now home to entire communities.\n\nThe risks go far beyond flooded basements. Entire systems critical to public safety and daily life could be thrown into crisis. Wastewater treatment plants, electric substations, and roads built at elevations sensitive to sea level rise could be compromised.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen the coastline drops, so does everything built on it, putting lives, homes, and infrastructure directly in harm’s way.\n\nA doubling, and eventually tripling, of exposure\n\nUntil recently, most models focused on immediate impacts: shaking, waves, and storm surges. But Dura’s new research reveals what happens when you factor in subsidence—and the results are startling.\n\nIf a megathrust earthquake were to happen today, the 100-year floodplain—the key metric used to determine which homes are at risk of flood, and what homes need to purchase flood insurance policies—expands by 115 square miles.\n\n“That doubles the exposure of resident structures and roads,” Dura explains.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn other words, half of the residents who would need flood insurance to cover damage caused by flooding following a megathrust earthquake are unlikely to know that they are at risk right now. And that’s just the start.\n\nBy 2100, due to the combined effects of sea-level rise from global warming, the floodplain expands by 145 square miles, tripling the exposure.\n\nThat one-two punch is a combo that few current models account for.\n\n“The studies that have been conducted so far ... haven’t really taken into account the long-term impacts of the subsidence,” Dura notes.\n\nThe result: a massive blind spot in our understanding of flood risk in the Pacific Northwest. And without that knowledge, thousands of homeowners might be dramatically underestimating their need for flood insurance.\n\nWhat homeowners can do now to understand and reduce risk\n\nJust one inch of floodwater can cause up to $25,000 in damage, according to FEMA. Yet, as Janet Ruiz of the Insurance Information Institute warns, flood damage and “damage from a tsunami is not covered under most standard homeowners, renters, or business insurance.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor homeowners in the Pacific Northwest, Dura’s study offers a critical opportunity to get ahead of that risk.\n\n“Residents can use our maps to locate themselves ... to see whether their house might lie within one of the projected post-earthquake floodplains,” she says.\n\nEven homes outside FEMA-designated flood zones could be pulled into future floodplains in an instant, making flood insurance a smart move now, before disaster strikes.\n\n“The major insurer of flood is the National Flood Insurance Program ... [which] provides coverage up to $250,000 for a structure and $100,000 for personal possessions,” Ruiz notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat might not be enough. Flooding following a tsunami triggered by the megathrust earthquake could destroy entire homes, not just damage the first floor, so owners of higher-value homes might need additional protection.\n\nAnd the risk isn’t only long-term. Areas newly vulnerable to subsidence might also start experiencing nuisance flooding, king tides, and coastal erosion well before the next major quake hits.\n\n“Twenty-five percent of flooding happens outside the designated flood zones,” Ruiz adds, which makes proactive planning even more essential.\n\nHomeowners should start by taking the following steps:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLocating their property on Dura’s projected floodplain maps.\n\nComparing National Flood Insurance Program policies with options from private insurers.\n\nReassessing their property’s flood risk based on elevation, proximity to water, and changing coastal conditions.\n\nHow likely is this ‘next great quake’?\n\nScientists refer to recurrence intervals to estimate how often major earthquakes occur on a given fault. For the Cascadia Subduction Zone, the geological record shows a pattern of megathrust quakes occurring roughly every 250 to 800 years.\n\n“We’re over 300 years out from the last earthquake,” says Dura. “Geologically speaking, we’re well within the window of possibility.”\n\nIn human terms, that can seem abstract, but the odds are very real. Unlike storms or seasonal weather events, earthquakes strike without warning, and the longer the buildup, the greater the risk.\n\n“Fifty years in geologic time is well within our plus or minus uncertainty,” Dura adds. “It really could happen any day.”"

The hurricane, which weakened briefly Tuesday night before strengthening again to a category four storm with wind speeds of 130mph (209km/h), is heading towards Cuba and then the Bahamas. Earlier, Melissa made landfall on Jamaica's coastline with winds of more than 185mph.

Jamaican authorities urged residents and visitors to continue sheltering, as nearly a third of the country last power.\n\nPhotos emerging from Jamaica since Hurricane Melissa made landfall show fallen trees and damaged homes. \"It's a catastrophic situation,\" the World Meteorological Organization's tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said at a press briefing, warning of storm surges up to four metres high. \"For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century, for sure.\" Roofs have been torn off hospitals, former Jamaican senator Imani Duncan-Price told the BBC. \"People are trying to rescue people in the middle of the storm just to save lives.\" Up to 30 inches (76cm) of rain is expected in some parts, with areas already experiencing flash flooding. Around 70% of the island's 2.8 million population lives within 5km of the sea. Jamaican PM Andrew Holness told CNN that he expects \"devastating impacts\". \"Reports that we have had so far would include damage to hospitals, significant damage to residential property, housing and commercial property as well,\" he told host Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night.

Flooding may displace crocodiles from their natural dwellings, Jamaican health officials said. \"Rising water levels in rivers, gullies, and swamps could cause crocodiles to move into residential areas,\" the South East Regional Health Authority said in a statement. \"Residents living near these areas are therefore advised to remain vigilant and avoid flood waters.\" Winston Warren, who said he lives less than 1km from the ocean, described \"a constant roar of water\". \"There are times you just wonder - are the waves going to come crashing into your house?\" he said. \"We've seen a lot of roofs blown off.\" One woman told the BBC: \"There is water coming in through the roof of my house.

        "content": "A popular ski resort town in Colorado is adopting a new AI Smart City Solution from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to help it better detect wildfires, as well as update a range of other city services.\n\nVail is expanding its firefighting toolbox as hotter, more arid weather with climate change raises wildfire risk in the western US. Colorado has suffered 11 of the 20 largest fires in state history just within the last five years. Researchers and first responders are increasingly exploring ways in which new AI tools might help them get ahead of blazes.\n\n“Fires are part of our life [now] in the mountains, and we have to be prepared for them,” Vail town manager Russell Forrest tells The Verge.\n\n“Fires are part of our life.”\n\nThe collaboration with HPE for wildfire detection came together quickly this year, as Forrest was keeping an eye on a wildfire burning about 30 miles away from his town in July. “One of the things that became very apparent with that fire is that rapid detection of the fire and then the response to that made a big difference and will continue to make a difference in terms of managing future fires where we are,” he says.\n\nForrest connected with HPE and the company Kamiwaza, which has developed an AI orchestration platform, to ask how AI might be able to help the town. Now, Vail is the first municipality in the US to adopt HPE’s new “smart city solution,“ developed alongside Kamiwaza, Nvidia, and several other tech companies.\n\nThe aim is to make it quicker and easier to analyze footage the town already takes using cameras placed on buses and high vantage points on the mountains. Until now, it was primarily people who analyzed those videos trying to spot signs of fire and sometimes being stymied by whether what they saw was smoke or fog. They might have to send people out to a place where there appeared to be a lightning strike to see if it had sparked a blaze.\n\nThe new AI-enhanced system can restore higher fidelity in the images if needed and then apply video analytics against it, HPE vice president of AI and hybrid cloud business development Robin Braun explains. It’s been trained to identify lightning strikes and smoke in real time. On the agentic back end, the Kamiwaza platform adds additional context like weather indications (has it been snowing lately or is there a red flag warning in effect?) that might indicate how serious of an event this is and how to respond.\n\nIn addition, geospatial data analysis provided by Blackshark.ai is also incorporated into the smart city system. It can utilize drone and satellite images to assess how dry or healthy vegetation is as a measure of fire risk, as well as see how close fire-prone brush is to homes to figure out what needs to be cleared.\n\nVail isn’t alone in testing out new AI tools for fire detection. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has developed an experimental Next Generation Fire System (NGFS) to automate fire detection from satellite imagery. It searches for heat anomalies to detect fires and then sends alerts through an online dashboard that debuted in February to keep first responders and other officials informed.\n\nA conundrum with all the excitement around using AI to detect fires is that the boom of new energy-hungry AI data centers has also led to a spate of new fossil fuel projects. Planet-heating pollution from new oil and gas infrastructure can literally add fuel to the fire by exacerbating climate change.\n\nEnergy demand is something Forrest says he considered, too, before implementing the new program. HPE’s smart city platform will run out of a nearby data center that is primarily powered by renewable energy. The data center is plugged into the local power grid with electricity provided by Holy Cross Energy, a rural electric co-op that says that 76 percent of its portfolio in 2024 was made of renewable energy (mostly wind). That’s a higher proportion than the nation as a whole; only about 20 percent of the US electricity mix comes from renewables.\n\nWildfire detection and prevention are only one piece of HPE’s smart city platform. Vail also plans to use it to streamline administrative tasks, including reviewing housing permits and business license applications, make sure municipal websites are in compliance with federal laws ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities, and more. A new “digital concierge” at the public library is supposed to help provide information to residents and visitors. The town of just 4,300 residents is inundated with up to 30,000 visitors a day during peak ski season, and the hope is that the AI platform can free up staff to tackle the most pressing priorities."

        "content": "This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nFueled by unusually warm waters, Hurricane Melissa this week turned into one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded. Now a new rapid attribution study suggests human-induced climate change made the deadly tropical cyclone four times more likely.\n\nHurricane Melissa collided with Jamaica on Tuesday, wreaking havoc across the island before tearing through nearby Haiti and Cuba. The storm, which reached Category 5, reserved for the hurricanes with the most powerful winds, has killed at least 40 people across the Caribbean so far. Now weakened to a Category 2, it continues its path toward Bermuda, where landfall is likely on Thursday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nEarly reports of the damage are cataclysmic, particularly in hardest-hit western Jamaica. Winds reaching speeds of 185 miles per hour and torrential rain flattened entire neighborhoods, decimated large swaths of agricultural lands and forced more than 25,000 people—locals and tourists alike—to seek cover in shelters or hotel ballrooms. According to the new attribution study from Imperial College London, climate change ramped up Melissa’s wind speeds by 7 percent, which increased damages by 12 percent.\n\nLosses could add up to tens of billions of dollars, experts say.\n\nThe findings echo similar reports released earlier this week on how global warming contributed to the likelihood and severity of Hurricane Melissa. Each of the analyses add to a growing body of research showing how ocean warming from climate change is fueling the conditions necessary for stronger tropical storms.\n\nHurricane Melissa is “kind of a textbook example of what we expect in terms of how hurricanes respond to a warming climate,” said Brian Soden, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami, who was not involved in the recent analyses. “We know that the warming ocean temperatures [are] being driven almost exclusively by increasing greenhouse gases.”\n\nThe storm has disrupted every aspect of life in this part of the Caribbean.\n\n“There’s been massive dislocation of services. We have people living in shelters across the country,” Dennis Zulu, United Nations resident coordinator in Jamaica, said in a press conference on Wednesday. “What we are seeing in preliminary assessments is a country that’s been devastated to levels never seen before.”\n\nThe Climate Connection\n\nFor the rapid attribution study, researchers at Imperial College used the peer-reviewed Imperial College Storm Model, known as IRIS, which has created a database of millions of synthetic tropical cyclone tracks that can help fill in gaps on how storms operate in the real world.\n\nThe model essentially runs simulations on the likelihood of a given storm’s wind speed—often the most damaging factor—in a pre-industrial climate versus the current climate. Applying IRIS to Hurricane Melissa is how the researchers determined that human-induced warming supercharged the cyclone’s wind speed by 7 percent."

Without power or phone coverage, much of the country is isolated and so information is trickling through. Authorities were only able to confirm the first deaths as a result of the hurricane over 24 hours after landfall. The bodies of three men and one woman were washed up by the flood waters in St Elizabeth Parish, local government minister Desmond McKenzie said. There, Prime Minister Andrew Holness said \"images of destruction are all around\". \"The damage is great, but we are going to devote all our energy to mount a strong recovery,\" he said. Three-quarters of the country are still without power, according to the latest media briefing. On the road west out of the capital Kingston we saw minimal damage - some structures torn down, trees strewn across roads and gardens. But once we arrived in central Jamaica we started to see how severely the island has been hit. The town of Mandeville has been, for want of a better word, flattened. A petrol station had lost its roof and most of its pumps. The main road that runs through the town is littered in debris, foliage is stuck to everything and bits of building material were scattered along the road. By early Wednesday the hurricane had made landfall in Cuba, causing flooding and damage. In Haiti more than 25 people were killed, most when a river burst its banks in Petit-Goave, the local mayor said. At its peak, the hurricane sustained winds of 298 km/h (185 mph) - stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 and killed 1,392 people. It has since weakened to a Category 3 hurricane.\n\nHurricane Melissa - what we know about the damage in Jamaica\n\nAs wind and rain lashed through the night, one local Jamaican official said the destruction resembled \"the scene of an apocalypse movie\". Many parts of Jamaica's western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds after the hurricane tore across the island with catastrophic force. People have shared clips of roads that became rivers, mudslides on the hills, roofs being ripped from buildings and palm trees tossed like tooth picks. In the town of Black River on the south-west coast, police officer Warrell Nicholson was sheltering in the damaged police station along with some residents. \"It's been devastating,\" he told the AFP news agency. Further up the coast, Andrew Houston Moncure was sheltering in the luxury hotel he owns, with his wife and 20-month-old son. At the height of the hurricane they barricaded themselves inside the shower, which they fortified with pillows and blankets. \"It was the most terrifying experience, especially with my son. The pressure is so low you struggle to breathe, and it just sounds like a freight train going over you,\" he told AFP. Across Jamaica's central parishes, flood waters rose to the roofs of two-storey homes, Kingston-based journalist Kimone Francis of The Jamaica Gleaner said. Verna Genus, a 73-year-old vegetable farmer, was sheltering from the storm with her sons and baby grandchild at her four-bedroom home in the village of Carlisle, St Elizabeth, when the hurricane ripped the zinc roof off her house. \"She was crying on the phone,\" her UK-based sister June said, adding: \"You are huddled up inside and then you look up then the roof is gone. I have never heard her like that - she was wailing 'we are all finished'.\" She is anxiously waiting for communications networks to be restored so she can talk to her sister. St Elizabeth, known as Jamaica's breadbasket, produces much of the island's produce. With crops submerged and fields destroyed, many farmers will struggle to financially recover. Jamaica's prime minister told the BBC in some instances \"there was total devastation\" and that one town named Black River had been \"totally destroyed\".\n\nOn the north coast, Montego Bay - the heart of Jamaica's tourism industry and home to its main airport - will also take time to get back on its feet. Montego city was split in two by flood waters, Mayor Richard Vernon said. He told BBC Breakfast: \"Once the wind subsided, we started to get a lot of heavy rain and that has led to massive floods right across the city. One side of the city is now cut off from the other due to roads being inundated by flood water.\" His immediate concern, he added, was simple: \"Check if everybody is alive.\" In rural Jamaica, the storm has left people shaken. Tamisha Lee, president of the Jamaica Network of Rural Women Producers, said: \"Right now, what I'm seeing is heavy rain, powerful wind, a lot of things flying all over the place, and trees uprooted. There is no electricity. I am feeling anxious and tense. The damage will be enormous.\" Meteorologists said Hurricane Melissa intensified at a speed rarely seen, its rapid strengthening fuelled by abnormally warm Caribbean waters - part of a broader trend linked to climate change. By the time it struck Jamaica, the storm had reached Category 5 strength, with gusts fierce enough to tear roofs from concrete homes, uproot trees and snap power poles. Health officials even issued a crocodile warning, cautioning that flood waters could drive the reptiles into residential areas. For thousands of tourists caught on the island, the storm brought terror and uncertainty."

The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. Rescuers located two bodies, and are still searching for the remaining five, who are believed to have been buried by snow. Eight others have been rescued and are in the capital Kathmandu getting treatment for their injuries. All these climbers were part of a group that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told BBC Nepali.\n\nThe bodies of the other five deceased climbers \"may be 10-15 feet below the snow\", said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks. \"It will take time to find them.\" Those killed include two Italians, a Canadian, a German, a French national, and two Nepalis who served as guides. Local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC on Monday that a rescue helicopter had landed in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp. One of the injured climbers told The Kathmandu Post that they had repeatedly called for help, to no avail. \"Had the rescue arrived on time, more lives could have been saved,\" he told the newspaper. Mr Mahato told reporters that rescue efforts were hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, which made it hard to fly helicopters or reach the site on foot. The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft).

Many of the roads are blocked by debris and people are isolated with little food, no power or running water, and no idea of when normalcy will return. The government said on Saturday that at least 28 people in Jamaica have died since the hurricane hit as a monster category five storm with 185 mph (297km/h) sustained winds. That is a near 50% jump in the death toll overnight, and the number could rise as officials clear their way into new parts of the island in the coming days. Local official Dr Dayton Campbell told the BBC 10 of those deaths were in Westmoreland. Westmoreland parish is believed to have the second highest number of unconfirmed deaths, after St Elizabeth to the south east. The eye of the storm hit somewhere between the two neighbouring parishes. At St Elizabeth an estimated 90% of homes have been destroyed.\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC News A town just outside of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish sits in ruins\n\nA long stretch of road headed west into Westmoreland Parish winds through a graveyard of trees – stacks of branches and limbs, cracked and twisted, blanketing the landscape for miles. It is grim evidence of Hurricane Melissa's ferocity - it was the strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history. Piles of debris are heaped on the parish's roadsides, next to battered buildings, shipping crates turned on their side and crowds of people wading through the destruction. On Saturday morning, men with machetes hacked through branches as thick as their arms, clearing patches of the road where traffic jams were at a standstill. A policeman with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest, part of a convoy accompanying an aid truck on its way to Westmoreland, hopped out of his vehicle to help direct traffic. \"We don't know what lies ahead,\" the officer told the BBC, describing what he has seen as \"total devastation\".\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Roy Perry says he has lost everything in the wake of the strongest hurricane in Jamaican history\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Anthony Burnett (left) and Gary Williams (right)\n\nThose living in Whitehouse, a coastal town and commercial hub on the edge of Westmoreland Parish, say the wait for assistance is becoming frustrating. Gary Williams said he has heard promises of incoming aid delivery, but \"they no turn up\". He sat in the shade on a makeshift stool in front of a building barely standing – its entire roof gone – unsure of what to do next. Williams said he lost his house in the storm and has \"nowhere to live\", suggesting he might sleep right where he is, outside on the front porch. Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Words can't explain the situation that we're in. It's horrible. I don't even know what to say. So many hopeless, helpless and lifeless people here right now.\"\n\nAbout 400,000 people in Jamaica were without power as of Friday, and an untold number more have no access to cell phone service or Wi-Fi, cut off from the outside world. Jamaica's transportation minister Daryl Vaz announced on Saturday that more than 200 StarLink devices have been deployed across the island to help people access the internet. He addressed criticism the government has received for its response, saying there were \"several factors\" contributing to delays. \"Refuelling, Areas for Landing, Accessibility and Timing/Visibility,\" Vaz said on X. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged that the \"immediate focus is on clearing debris, restoring essential services\", as well as providing food and medical supplies. But that would only solve part of the problem.\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Residents of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish try to piece their lives back together\n\nIn a tiny community just outside of Whitehouse, Robert Morris rested against a slab of broken concrete. Behind him, the fishing village he has called home his entire life has been destroyed, along with his livelihood. \"We all devastated here, man,\" he said. He said the boat house was destroyed and is now \"flat\". \"Melissa take everything down,\" he said, including his fishing boat, which he describes as \"mashed up\". Morris also told of \"no help, no food, no water\". \"We just have to try and see what we can do,\" he said, adding that his plan was to find someone whose boat was still intact so that he could join and fish. Even then, he is not sure where he would sell his catch. The people in these areas are filled with pride and resilience, words that are often repeated on local radio stations and visible through their optimism in the most difficult circumstances. Seated under the facade of a badly damaged building, Roy Perry said he has lost everything, but \"we have to just keep the faith and the hope is up still\".\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Robert Morris fishing village in view over his right shoulder has been entirely destroyed\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Oreth Jones, a local farmer, said his farm was \"all wrecked\""

        "content": "Hurricane Melissa death toll rises to 28 in Jamaica\n\nThe category five hurricane - the strongest type - has caused dozens of deaths across the Caribbean, bringing powerful winds and landslides to Cuba and Haiti.\n\nEmergency responders and aid agencies have struggled to reach certain parts of the island in the aftermath of the storm due to blocked roads, debris and flooding.\n\nAndrew Holness confirmed nine other deaths on Saturday, adding that there were reports of possible fatalities still being verified - suggesting the figure may yet rise.\n\nThe number of people killed in Jamaica as a result of Hurricane Melissa has risen to 28, the Caribbean nation's prime minister has announced.\n\nThe full scale of the destruction Melissa wrought on Jamaica has only become clear in the past few days as the hurricane knocked out communication systems and power to much of the island after it made landfall on Tuesday.\n\nCommunities on the island's western portion, such as Black River and Montego Bay, have seen the worst of the destruction.\n\nImages have emerged showing buildings razed to the ground, debris and belongings strewn on streets, and whole neighbourhoods still under floodwater.\n\nThe Red Cross says that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.\n\nJamaican officials confirmed to news agency AFP that multiple field hospitals were being established to treat people in the worst-affected areas in the west.\n\nAid reaching those in need was initially held up by the temporary closure of Jamaica's airports.\n\nNow that it is arriving in the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating its distribution.\n\nWith so many in need of clean drinking water, food and medicine, there have been reports of desperate people entering supermarkets and pharmacies to gather what they can.\n\nMelissa has become the most powerful storm on record to hit Jamaica, and one of the strongest seen in the Caribbean.\n\nAt its peak, the hurricane had sustained winds of 185mph (295 km/h). A category five hurricane - those capable of catastrophic damage - has winds in excess of 157mph.\n\nAt least 31 people have been killed in Haiti as a result of Melissa, while at least two deaths have been reported in the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn Cuba, thousands of people have been evacuated as more than 60,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall."

Rescuers struggled for hours to reach the scene as heavy rain had also caused landslides on both sides of the pass, cutting off access. Rescue teams were only able to reach the bus after midnight, according to state media.\n\n“Rocks and soil fell down with a loud bang.

Over 800 passengers on four trains were still stranded on Monday evening.\n\nFlood waters inundated the Du Long Industrial Park on Monday, which houses several factories, including German and South Korean companies. Rains submerged factories by 1 meter (3.2 feet) of water and forced the power cuts, forcing thousands of workers to halt operations.\n\nTorrential rain also flooded a national highway in the province of Dak Lak, prompting police to block the road and redirect traffic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the city of Hue, floods triggered landslides on Sunday in mountainous areas, blocking a major highway that runs from northern to southern Vietnam and cutting off several villages, isolating thousands, while in Quang Ngai province, rainfall of 150 to 235 mm (5.9–9.3 inches) collapsed a bridge over a stream, stranding 1,200 residents in remote hamlets.\n\nOn Sunday night, a tornado tore through the southern areas of Danang city and Quang Ngai province, ripping roofs from dozens of houses, uprooting trees and scattering debris.\n\nVietnam is among the world’s most flood-prone countries, with nearly half its population living in high-risk areas. Scientists warn that a warming climate is intensifying storms and rainfall across Southeast Asia, making floods and landslides increasingly destructive and frequent.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "content": "As Category 5 Hurricane Melissa bears down on Jamaica with winds topping 180 mph, social media is being hit by a surge of AI-generated and misleading videos, showing catastrophic flooding, collapsing buildings and rescue scenes that never happened.\n\nAcross X, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media platforms, fake clips spread quickly, racking up millions of views in hours. Many of these videos are spliced footage from past storms or clips created entirely with text-to-video AI tools.\n\nCNET\n\nIn times of crisis, like a dangerous and imminent natural disaster, these fake videos can create confusion, panic and distraction at a time when accuracy can be life-saving.\n\nNatural disasters have always bred rumors and recycled footage, but the rise of AI-generated video has supercharged the problem. Tools like OpenAI's Sora and other AI-video platforms can render realistic-looking images of storms, floods and damage scenes in seconds, reaching millions online in just a few hours.\n\nRead more: The Deepfakes Are Winning. How Can You Tell if a Video Is Real or Sora AI?\n\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.\n\nWhy storms are a magnet for fake news\n\nStorms are visual, emotional and fast-moving, which is the perfect recipe for viral misinformation. In years past, videos were often taken out of context or labeled as a different storm. Now, they can be digitally fabricated from scratch.\n\nSome depict apocalyptic flooding that hasn't occurred, while others claim to show \"real-time\" conditions hours before landfall. Several videos that have circled this week include images of sharks swimming in the storm surge and unsettling depictions of human suffering.\n\nFalse videos like these can exaggerate the danger of the storm, create panic, undermine trust and distract emergency responders, as misinformation pulls attention from verified reports.\n\nThe following three videos are all fake. They are labeled (albeit briefly) with the Sora watermark, which indicates they were made in OpenAI's video generator.\n\nHow to separate truth from fiction online\n\nWhen social feeds fill with dramatic hurricane clips, it's important to separate truth from fiction.\n\n\"You have to be very discerning,\" Sen. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's information minister, said. \"You have to know what is good information from bad information. If you want to know where the storm is going, if you want to know what to do, you need to look for official sources.\"\n\nDixon highlighted that the Jamaica Information Service, Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management's information sites and the Office of the Prime Minister page are resources for legitimate, timely updates.\n\nHere are some ways to be discerning.\n\nCheck the source. If the video comes from an unfamiliar account, lacks a timestamp or carries no recognizable media branding, assume it is fake until verified. Also, look for the Sora watermark indicating it was made in OpenAI's app, or read the comments to see if someone else has flagged the video as fake.\n\nAsk yourself if it's new and local. Does the geography match Jamaica? Is the footage recent? Many \"Melissa\" clips could actually be from past Caribbean or Gulf storms.\n\nCross-check before believing. Confirm through trusted outlets, like the Meteorological Service of Jamaica and the US National Hurricane Center, or established media like the BBC, Reuters or the Associated Press.\n\nPause before sharing. A viral video can cause harm if it spreads misinformation. Wait until a credible source verifies it before reposting.\n\nGo local. If you're in the affected area, rely on local emergency agencies, radio stations and city or county-level officials for evacuation and safety updates.\n\nMonitor official alerts. For real-time instructions, stick with government channels and local emergency feeds. Your safety depends on accurate information, not viral content.\n\nAs AI-generated media becomes easier to produce, hurricanes like Melissa offer a preview of a new reality: one in which you can't trust much of the information you see online.\n\nStaying safe means being skeptical and diligent when looking for accurate and even lifesaving news.\n\nRead more: What Is AI Slop?

        "content": "AI-assisted summary Torrential thunderstorms caused severe flooding and a temporary closure of the Boca Raton Airport.\n\nWest Palm Beach set a new rainfall record with 2.37 inches falling in a 24-hour period.\n\nA rare \"considerable\" flash flood warning was issued for Boca Raton due to the severity of the flooding.\n\nThe skies opened and bellowed for hours with torrential thunderstorms shutting down the Boca Raton Airport and setting a record in West Palm Beach where 2.37 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period beginning early on Oct. 26.\n\nStoked by a gooey warm ribbon of air stalled over Central Florida and a knotty trough of energy traveling fast and high overhead, the storms that convened along Palm Beach County’s coast triggered flash-flood warnings that cautioned 3 to 5 inches of rain had fallen in Boca Raton in a single hour with up to 2 more inches expected before midnight approached.\n\nThe warning was later slapped with the “considerable” label — a rare escalation issued when flash flooding is unusually severe.\n\n“There was just a very isolated bull's-eye over Boca Raton. If you were in Miami, you wouldn’t even know it was raining,” said National Weather Service meteorologist George Rizzuto. “These weather features co-located and led to the pretty heavy showers last night.”\n\nWhile the Boca Raton Airport temporarily closed “due to severe flooding,” it was reopened as of 7 a.m. on Oct. 27.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami said homes in Boca Raton near Southwest 18th Street and Southwest 8th Avenue had water completely covering their yards and “almost entering homes.” Cars were submerged up to the top of their wheel wells at Palmetto Park Road and State Road A1A.\n\n\"City crews and public safety teams are out this morning assessing storm impacts across the community,\" the city of Boca Raton posted on social media. \"Please use extra caution on the road, as there may be abandoned or stalled vehicles and areas of localized flooding.\"\n\nRecord rainfall throughout Palm Beach County\n\nSouth Florida Water Management District gauges measured 6.38 inches of rain in coastal Delray Beach. A gauge near South Military Trail in Boca Raton measured 6.74 inches.\n\nBoynton Beach received 4.62 inches, a gauge at the West Palm Beach and Lake Worth Beach border measured 5.83 inches and 3.12 inches was measured in North Palm Beach, with 3.21 inches falling in Jupiter.\n\nThe record 2.37 inches at Palm Beach International Airport beat the previous record of 1.62 inches for the same day in 2012.\n\nA report from the NWS shows that Deerfield Beach, near the border of Boca Raton, got 8.64 inches of rain. It lists Lantana has having received 6.6 inches of rain and an area of the town of Palm Beach got 6.06 inches.\n\nSouth Florida is just two weeks into the dry season. The wet season officially runs May 15 through Oct. 15 for the seven counties overseen by the Miami NWS office. Those include Palm Beach, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Broward, Collier, Glades and Hendry.\n\nPalm Beach County was considered in drought through much of the wet season, but was drought free as of Oct. 16, according to the U.S. Drought Monitory.\n\nPBIA measured 31 inches of rain during the wet season, which was down 6.14 inches from normal. Palm Beach Gardens measured 31.36 inches, which was a deficit of 9 inches. About 38.7 inches of rain fell in the Greenacres and Lake Worth Beach area, which was about normal, according to the weather service.\n\nCold weather forecast for Florida, Palm Beach County\n\nThe Oct. 26 and Oct. 27 rainfall precedes two cold fronts that are forecast to sweep down the Florida peninsula on Oct. 29 with the first weaker front reinforced by a more robust push of Canadian air that will drop temperatures into the low 60s in coastal Palm Beach County on Halloween morning.\n\nHigh temperatures on Oct. 30 are forecast to reach into the mid-70s. Those are forecast to barely clear 70 degrees on Oct. 31 with the official forecast for West Palm Beach reaching 73 degrees.\n\nThat means temperatures will be running near 10 degrees below normal. The average daytime high in West Palm Beach for Oct. 31 is 82 degrees with the normal overnight low dipping just to 69 degrees.\n\nThe last time it hit 65 degrees or below in West Palm Beach was on April 17.\n\n“By Thursday, we will really start feeling the impacts,” said Zach Law, a meteorologist with the NWS in Melbourne about the cold front. “It’s going to be very comfortable.”\n\nHow will the colder temperatures affect iguanas?\n\nThe cold temperatures won't do anything to cull the invasive green iguana herd that has proliferated in South Florida.\n\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officials said iguanas can become either immobilized or sluggish when temperatures hit between 40 and 50 degrees. Longer cold snaps with overcast skies that prevent basking for warmth can be deadly as the paralyzed iguanas become easy prey to vultures, bobcats and coyotes.\n\nAlso, when the lizards are immobilized by the cold, their digestive systems sour and they die from bacterial infections. Iguanas that fall from trees onto streets are also in danger of becoming road kill.\n\nThe last significant die-off of iguanas caused by cold weather occurred during the winter of 2010 when between Jan. 2 and Jan. 13, West Palm Beach's overnight lows dipped into the 30s nine times.\n\nThis week's fronts are part of the seasonal change that sees the jet stream taking deeper forays into the subtropics during the winter months.\n\nThis time, the journey south will also protect Florida from Hurricane Melissa, which deepened to a Category 5 hurricane with 160 mph winds as of early Oct. 27.\n\nIt's typically not until early November when overnight low temperatures in South Florida dip into the upper 60s. And the area must wait until the middle to latter part of November before daytime high temperatures peak in the upper 70s.\n\nMelissa is the third Category 5 hurricane this season following Erin and Humberto. Only one other Atlantic hurricane season has had more than two Category 5 storms. That was 2005 with Emily, Katrina, Rita and Wilma, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nJamaica is bracing for Melissa, which will likely be the most powerful hurricane on record to hit the island, and is forecast to bring up to 40 inches of rain in some areas.\n\nHurricane Gilbert in 1988 made landfall in Jamaica as a Category 4 storm with maximum wind speeds of 130 mph.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned of catastrophic and life-threatening landslides and flash flooding through Oct. 28 in Jamaica.\n\n“Destructive winds, especially in the mountains, will begin by this evening, leading to extensive infrastructural damage, long-lasting power and communication outages, and isolated communities,” NHC forecasters said in their 5 a.m. update on Oct. 27.\n\nHurricane season runs through Nov. 30.\n\nKimberly Miller is a journalist for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network of Florida.

They are among the UK nationals on the island bracing themselves for what could be the most powerful storm ever to hit Jamaica. The couple are due to fly back to the UK on Wednesday but the possibility of severe flooding as a result of the storm has left this uncertain.\n\nHurricane Melissa is forecast to bring \"catastrophic and life-threatening conditions, and made landfall with with winds of up to 185mph (297km/h). Some forecasters say the storm could remain a category five when it reaches the island in the coming hours.\n\n'Like a ghost town'\n\nSupplied Rob Cuff and his wife Leah are in Jamaica on their honeymoon\n\nMr Cuff, from Telford, said their \"hotel has been absolutely brilliant, and they have boarded up windows and taped up glass and have looked after us\". He added: \"Yesterday evening, we had to leave our rooms and go to a safer building nearby.\" The couple are not the only Britons in Jamaica celebrating a significant milestone. Rebecca Chapman is in Jamaica for her 25th wedding anniversary and told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she and her family have also been told not to leave their hotel room. \"There's this weird roar that sounds like it's coming from the sea. It's really odd, like something's coming. The birds have all gone so it's all gone really quiet. It's like a ghost town,\" she said.\n\nMegan Berry Megan Berry is in Jamaica says she has a bag packed ready in case she is evacuated\n\nMegan Berry, a primary school teacher from west London, is currently in Montego Bay. She flew to Jamaica on Saturday for a friend's birthday. She told the BBC that the hotel she is in went into lockdown on Monday night and they have been advised to put mattresses against the windows. They have also packed their bags in case they need to be evacuated. Another British family say they have prepared a \"shelter\" in the bathroom of their hotel room - with food, drink, spare clothing, bedding in there. Brian Johnson, who is on holiday with his wife and wider family, said their focus is getting through unscathed. \"If we need help at any time during the main storm it is unlikely to be available, so we are essentially on our own.\" He said they are extremely thankful to their local Jamaican hosts and staff, many of whom are staying at the hotel to support guests despite having families and properties to take care of.\n\n'Staff amazing'\n\nAndrew Brearley and his wife Julia from Manchester came to Montego Bay for their 25th wedding anniversary. Their hotel is just 182m (600ft) away from the beach. What would have been a scenic view is now a constant reminder of what's looming. As they sit in the bathroom of their hotel, he says \"I just want to come out the other side of this storm\". Despite such uncertain times, like Mr Johnson they say the sense of community around the hotel is strong. \"The staff have been amazing, they haven't show any despair, they're doing everything they can to make sure we're safe and they're safe. The workers were given the choice to go or stay in the hotel, and a lot of them stayed.\" Meanwhile, David Rowe and his family made the decision to leave their holiday in Montego Bay early and fly home to Hertfordshire on Monday because of the storm. \"We made the decision on Saturday morning that no matter what we have to get home for the safety of the children,\" he told the BBC. \"We can't believe that when we were leaving on Sunday there were flights landing full of holiday makers.\" \"It has been an emotional time,\" Mr Rowe said, adding that they \"feel for anyone\" still in Jamaica.\n\nDisaster response\n\nAs well as British holidaymakers, the BBC has spoken to Britons anxiously watching from afar as their loved ones prepare for impact. Among them is Jodi Jenny, who now lives in Northamptonshire but grew up in the Jamaican parish of St Mary and still has loved ones living there, including her grandfather. She says that while the country is used to storms, she cannot remember one as bad as this is forecast to be since Hurricane Gilbert, which killed more than 300 people when it hit Jamaica in the 1980s. \"This is a bad one,\" Ms Jenny told BBC Radio Northampton. \"It's just tough. You can't do anything about it.\"\n\nDonnalee Ellis Donnalee Ellis now lives in London but was in Jamaica when Hurricane Gilbert struck in the 1980s"

Locals and tourists told the BBC how they hunkered down as the storm ripped roofs off buildings and cut power to about a third of the country's 2.8 million people. \"The doors are being blown off by the wind,\" said Kabien, a mother-of-three who runs a beauty salon in the town of Santa Cruz. With panic in her voice, she said: \"I am trying to use my own manpower to stop the wind blowing in the door.\"\n\nWatch: Strong winds and flying debris as Hurricane Melissa makes landfall\n\n\"There is water coming through the roof of the house,\" she said. \"I am not OK.\" Her three young children were \"very, very scared\", she added. Melissa made landfall on Tuesday afternoon in south-western Jamaica near the town of New Hope with wind speeds of 185 mph (295 km/h), according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC). Originally a category five storm, it was downgraded to category three after it made landfall and swept across the island. Officials said it would continue to decrease in intensity, but remain extremely dangerous as it moves towards Cuba and then the Bahamas. Kyle Holmes, from Bolton, who is visiting Jamaica with his wife and young daughters, aged 7, 10, and 12, for a family wedding, told the BBC of the devastation wreaked by the storm. He said the hotel he was staying in - the Grand Palladium Resort, in the town of Lucea, half an hour from Montego Bay on the coast - looks like \"a disaster zone\". He said he barricaded the windows to the hotel room by placing all the furniture against them, and his family were safe after the \"worst experience ever\".\n\nGetty Images A man installs storm shutters in Portmore; preparations for Hurricane Melissa have been ongoing for days across Jamaica\n\nWinston Warren, who has been riding out the hurricane from inside his home in east Kingston, less than a kilometre from the ocean, told the BBC: \"There are times you just wonder - are the waves going to come crashing into your house. \"We've seen a lot of roofs blown off.\" Emma, who is on a family holiday in Jamaica from Essex, England, said the windows of their Montego Bay hotel had been smashed by high winds. \"We moved to a safe room as the children were petrified,\" she said. \"The windows have been blown through and the staff are working furiously to make us safe. \"We have all just moved to another room in the building as the glass in the lobby is unsafe. We are all terrified.\" Damion, a computer scientist living in Kingston, told the BBC he had woken on Tuesday to winds \"so strong you would not be able to stand up\" outside. Simon Johnson, 33, who lives in Harbour View in Kingston with his wife and two sisters, said the family had experienced hurricanes before - \"but not one of this size\". Living just 200m (650ft) from the harbour, he told the BBC he was \"feeling anxious\". They have stockpiled a week's worth of food, he added, but many of the supermarkets were empty and he could not find any bread in the neighbourhood.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'The birds have all gone'"

        "content": "Seismometers picked up the ferocious winds and waves of Hurricane Melissa, showing how the tools can be used to better understand storms today and those from the past\n\nHurricane Melissa will go down as one of the worst hurricanes ever in the Atlantic Ocean, with the hurricane reaching a strength that only a handful of storms have achieved in recorded history. Melissa was so powerful—with astounding 185-mile-per-hour peak winds—that it literally made the ground tremble hundreds of miles away in Florida, where its march across the ocean was picked up on seismometers, instruments designed to detect earthquakes.\n\nThough plenty of intense storms have shown up on these sensors before, the recordings underscore the destructive force of the Melissa, a Category 5 hurricane that devastated parts of Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. They also highlight how a tool that is typically used for geological purposes can improve our understanding of one Earth’s most ferocious weather phenomena—in particular, by opening a window into the hurricanes that raged before satellites and plane reconnaissance was possible.\n\nDespite seismic waves being readily associated with fault movements and their tremors, “seismometers aren’t just used for earthquakes,” says seismologist and earthquake geologist Wendy Bohon, whose organizational affiliation can’t currently be given because of the ongoing shutdown of the federal government. “Seismometers detect anything that puts energy into the ground. That could be Taylor Swift concerts; that could be construction; that could be people walking around seismometers.” Landslides, avalanches, asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions and clandestine nuclear weapons explosions all appear as curious squiggles in the tools’ output because they all generate seismic waves.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nHurricanes and typhoons are no exception, and they wobble Earth’s crust in two different ways. The first is “due to the wind vibrating trees, telegraph poles, fenceposts, etcetera, which then couples into the ground as a seismic wave,” says Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at University College London.\n\nThe second, more major component comes from the storms jostling the ocean itself. “As waves go up and down, they drum on the ocean floor,” Bohon says. Sometimes this percussive action is represented on seismometers by subtle peaks and troughs. Hurricane Melissa ominously registered on Jamaica’s seismometers as eerily obvious serrated teeth in the days leading up to landfall. “It makes your heart drop a little bit because you recognize the ferocity of the storm,” Bohon says.\n\nHurricanes and typhoons are tracked and studied relatively easily in real time: barometers and daring “Hurricane Hunter” pilots record changes in air pressure, oceanic sensors monitor changing temperatures, and satellites can build three-dimensional pictures of these maelstroms. Seismometers, which run continuously and can be found all over the world, can also be used to track the trajectory of the hurricane, says Andreas Fichtner, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.\n\nDownload the video EarthScope Consortium\n\nAlthough helpful in the here and now, this is particularly useful for understanding hurricanes in the somewhat more antiquated past—back when aerial surveys and satellite sleuthing weren’t options. “In the presatellite era, we already had a seismic network on the surface of the Earth,” Fichtner says. It’s not anywhere near as dense as it is today, but it’s still sufficient for hurricane researchers hoping to rewind time so they can find out where tropical cyclones used to be born and where the storms previously dissolved away.\n\nThis multidecadal seismic soundtrack also shows potential in determining the intensities of past hurricanes. Storm-generated seismic waves are effectively recording changes in ocean wave height. That means scientists could calibrate the cacophony of today’s hurricanes with their intensity and then use what’s preserved in old seismic catalogs to see if cyclones have become stronger over time.\n\nAs sea-surface temperatures have risen dramatically with global warming, climate models have predicted that, over the coming years, hurricanes will get stronger, bringing higher wind speeds, greater rainfall and more vigorous storm surges to bear on anyone in their paths. There are some indications that this effect is already in play. And if, as recent research suggests, seismometers can determine the strength of tropical storms that existed long ago, our understanding of this trend will undoubtedly improve.\n\nThe fact that seismometers can be used in an unconventional way to study our rapidly changing world is fascinating, Bohon says. But seeing increasingly savage storms such as Melissa appear on these sensors is also “frightening and heartbreaking,” she adds."

        "content": "FEMA promised funds to tsunami-proof an Oregon hospital. That money is MIA\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\nEight years ago, Erik Thorsen — CEO of Columbia Memorial Hospital in Astoria, Ore. — received a warning that no hospital administrator wants to hear: A big earthquake could cause his hospital's building to collapse. His staff and his patients could die in a matter of moments.\n\n\"They basically said, 'None of you are prepared for a major natural disaster from the Cascadia subduction zone,'\" recalls Thorsen.\n\nThe Cascadia subduction zone is an earthquake-prone region that stretches about 700 miles from California to British Columbia. Thorsen's hospital sits right along it — which is why a team of experts and engineers from the state had come to talk to him and other leaders from coastal hospitals about earthquake risk.\n\nAlarmed, Thorsen — who grew up in this area, left for college, and then returned to raise his family here — got to work fundraising and planning in order to fortify his hospital to withstand an earthquake and provide shelter during a tsunami.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA critical part of the project's $300 million budget was to come from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Their $14 million grant would help to build a tsunami evacuation zone in the hospital.\n\nBut in April, the Trump administration canceled the grant program that awarded the funding, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. A report from the Urban Institute estimates this cancellation jeopardizes over $3 billion nationally in hazard mitigation funds to protect communities from threats like floods, wildfires, tornadoes and hurricanes.\n\nWhen the news reached Astoria, construction plans were already well under way.\n\n\"We did go back to the design team and say, 'What would it take to actually take these elements out?'\" says Mark Kujala, a Clatsop County commissioner who worked on fundraising for the project. \"And because it's so integrated into the project, that just wasn't feasible.\"\n\nThe hospital broke ground in September. The current plan for filling the $14 million hole left by FEMA: There is no plan.\n\n\"Unfortunately, FEMA — even prior to the shutdown, had kind of gone silent on us,\" says Thorsen. \"And now with the shutdown … very silent on us.\"\n\nNo worse place to locate a hospital\n\nColumbia Memorial Hospital was constructed in its current location in 1977, when earthquake risk was not as well understood. In addition to being constructed in a zone vulnerable to a major earthquake, the hospital sits in a low-lying plain just blocks from the waterfront, on unstable ground.\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\n\"The theory is if the earthquake happened, that ground underneath us would liquefy and the building would potentially collapse,\" says Thorsen. \"If we happen to remain upright and a tsunami comes our way, maybe we get 20 to 30 minutes of notice to evacuate people up the hill.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat would mean moving vulnerable patients — in some cases, critically ill patients — out of their environment and into another, in the middle of a disaster zone, in a matter of minutes. Other earthquake-prone places like Japan have already built such structures to avoid this scenario by moving to higher ground within their buildings. But Oregon is late to the game, some experts say.\n\n\" We're sitting here on — you know the overused phrase — [a] ticking time bomb,\" says Chris Goldfinger, who studies paleoseismology at Oregon State University.\n\nA magnitude 9 earthquake, says Goldfinger, is a realistic possibility in the Cascadia subduction zone.\n\n\"Those happen on average just under [once every] 500 years,\" says Goldfinger. \"We're 325 years since the last one.\"\n\nAt least 25,000 people could die in this scenario, according to some estimates.\n\nThere are only three hospitals in Oregon in this region.\n\n\"Honestly, with this project, we could be the only hospital that could survive and serve the residents — for about 60,000 people,\" says Thorsen. \"It's a big responsibility.\"\n\nCurrently the hospital is a sprawling, one-story building, and modeling has predicted that several feet of water could flood the hospital's ground floor during a tsunami. When it is complete, the new hospital will be dramatically taller, growing from one story to four (plus a fifth level for a helipad). The idea behind the vertical evacuation zone is that once the earthquake has stopped and the new building is still standing, people can congregate in the top several floors, built especially to be able to withstand a tsunami.\n\ntoggle caption ZGF Architects\n\nIn order to help mitigate that potential disaster, engineers designed a plan to anchor the hospital to bedrock 65 feet deep. \"The building is 97 feet and the helipad sits on the roof,\" says Thorsen, gesturing to the hospital and describing its new design. A 100-foot drill — basically an enormous version of the kind of drill bit one might find in a household toolbox — is already making deep holes to secure the piles.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough the Pacific Northwest is beginning to build these kinds of structures, Goldfinger says, they're hard to finance without federal support. \"The federal government is really the only entity that's large enough to deal with this as a national-level problem,\" he says. \"It's just well beyond anything that the states could do alone.\"\n\n\"It is just incredibly frustrating\"\n\nThough Thorsen and his staff say they were given some indication that existing BRIC grants would still be distributed, they've yet to see any money.\n\nThe BRIC program was established under the first Trump administration in order to fortify communities against natural disasters. After it was canceled, a lawsuit challenged the program's termination and a federal judge issued an injunction.\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\n\"It is just incredibly frustrating,\" says Democratic Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, who represents the area. Bonamici says she and her staff have been pleading with anyone who will listen to help access the money.\n\n\" I lost count of how many calls I have made, trying to get somebody from FEMA on the phone,\" says Bonamici.\n\nFEMA did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nPlans for a new hospital, says Bonamici, provided her peace of mind about a potential catastrophe in her district. Some predictions forecast a magnitude 9 earthquake here could be the worst natural disaster the U.S. has ever seen.\n\n\"It is going to be a safe place not just for patients or employees in the hospital, but for the community, \" says Bonamici. \"They can't outrun a tsunami. \"\n\nIn addition to saving lives, she says, the project will save property and money. \"It is really critical that — now that they're underway with construction — this funding comes through.\"\n\nWaste, fraud, and abuse hits different at a local level\n\nWhen Trump officials started talking about cutting \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" Willis Van Dusen was enthusiastic. A registered Republican, Van Dusen was mayor of Astoria for more than two decades. Eliminating waste, he says, is what he and fellow Republicans wanted.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"This is what Trump ran on,\" he says.\n\nBut when Trump's \"waste, fraud and abuse\" campaign came to his town, Van Dusen says he felt differently. \"What is more important than a hospital in a rural community like Astoria?\" he asks.\n\nAstoria has a history as a fishing and logging town, but more recently it's given way to big-city retirees and craft breweries. It's a rare, politically moderate area — a place, says Van Dusen, where neighborhoods are socioeconomically mixed and people are typically more concerned with questions of practical issues like trash collection than identity politics.\n\nFew issues are more practical than having a trusted hospital nearby, says Van Dusen. When he had a heart attack some years ago, it was doctors at Columbia Memorial who brought him back. \"I had actually died,\" he says, pointing to a framed EKG reading he keeps in his office.\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\nMaking sure that this hospital can keep providing care during an earthquake and tsunami, he says, is the opposite of waste, fraud and abuse.\n\n\"Just to jerk that money away from us,\" he says, \"it makes me livid.\"\n\nVan Dusen says he's not the only one in this town who's mad, regardless of political party. \"Every single Republican that I have talked to is livid over what's happening,\" he adds.\n\nHospital CEO Erik Thorsen says they are not giving up — even without the federal money. Construction continues. They've been thinking through other ways to finance it.\n\nThorsen feels a responsibility for protecting this community where he has spent most of his life. \"We have this obligation to make sure that our patients and our residents and citizens are safe,\" he says.\n\nWithout the federal government, though, the path ahead is unclear.\n\n"

Musk, like most economists who have studied the topic, said that physical labor jobs and careers that require some element of human interaction are likely to stay around.\n\n\"Anything that's physically moving atoms, like cooking food or farming, anything that's physical, those jobs will exist for a much longer time,\" he said. \"But anything that is digital, which is just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning.\"\n\nMusk is mostly bullish on the long-term benefits of artificial intelligence, provided a Terminator-esque scenario doesn't come to fruition.\n\nIn a much more \"benign scenario,\" Musk said, wealth will be accessible to virtually everyone, leading to a \"universal high income.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, working will be optional because you'll have robots plus AI,\" he said. \"And we'll have, in a benign scenario, universal high income, not just universal basic income.

Other tech leaders, including OpenAI's Sam Altman, have questioned Amodei's outlook.\n\nMusk said that his ideal version of the future \"kind of sounds like heaven.\" Rogan said that without worrying about work, people can now spend their days doing whatever they want.\n\n\"Like I said, not every path is a good path,\" Musk said. \"But I think if we push it in the direction of maximally truth-seeking and curious, then I think AI will want to take care of humanity and foster humanity because we're interesting.\""

The roof of the house Davis and his parents shared in the small Jamaican fishing community of White House in Westmoreland parish was also destroyed.\n\nDavis was in Nicaragua, where he'd flown shortly before the storm to find new customers for his fish business. But now his livelihood, and the livelihoods of many in his community, were in peril.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“It’s going to be very rough” said Davis. “With the damage now, no one will be buying products.”\n\nAbout 29 kilometers (17 miles) northwest in Amity, also in Westmoreland parish, Denver Thorpe lost 15 acres (6 hectares) of mango trees and two greenhouses on his farm.\n\n“There’s absolutely nothing,” said Thorpe, a farmer and regional manager for the Jamaica Agricultural Society, a farmer advocacy organization.\n\nHurricane Melissa is blamed for at least 28 deaths in Jamaica, bringing catastrophic winds up to 185 mph (298 kph) and storm surge that wrecked homes and public infrastructure.\n\nWhile official damage assessments are still underway, experts said it's already clear that one of the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded also dealt a devastating blow to tens of thousands of Jamaican fishers and farmers who feed their families and nearby communities.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSimilar impacts will be felt by some of Cuba and Haiti ’s small producers, said Lola Castro, World Food Program regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n“I would say every (crop) that was on the path has been damaged, there’s no discussion on that,” said Castro. “Some of the fruit trees may be recovered, some of the temporary crops will not be recovered at all.”\n\nThe destruction will impact how residents earn income and feed their families at a time when they must also rebuild homes and communities. There were already 10 million food-insecure people across the affected countries of Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, said Castro. The WFP does not have that data for Cuba.\n\nIn Jamaica, the destruction comes just 15 months after Hurricane Beryl impacted more than 50,000 farmers and 11,000 fishers, and caused $4.73 billion Jamaican dollars (about $29 million) in losses, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“We were just about turning the corner,” said Thorpe.\n\n‘The lifeblood of the most vulnerable’\n\nJamaica’s agriculture ministry did not respond to questions about sector impacts, but the country has more than 200,000 farmers tending livestock and growing bananas, melons, cocoa and much more.\n\nThe food produced is for domestic consumption and export — Jamaica is one of the world's largest yam exporters and its coffee growers generate $25 million annually, according to the Jamaica Coffee Exporters Association.\n\nAround 80% are small-scale producers, working on 2 hectares of land or less, said Donovan Campbell, geography professor and director of the University of the West Indies’ western campus.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Small-scale fishing and small-scale farming is what most people use to make a living,” he said. “It is really the lifeblood of the most vulnerable in our society.”\n\nFarmers use October rains to plant crops to harvest before Christmas. Before the storm, the agriculture ministry urged fishers to move equipment out of harm's way and farmers to move livestock and harvest any crops they could.\n\nThe devastation exceeded most expectations. Officials Wednesday said St. Elizabeth parish, known as Jamaica's “breadbasket,\" was “ under water.\" The parish had over 35,000 registered farmers and fishers as of 2022, according to the Jamaica Information Service.\n\nFor fishers, Davis said it's not just losing boats, nets and traps that endangers their work. Without electricity, there’s no ice to store what they catch, and customers won’t buy what they can’t keep cold. Lack of tourism will hurt demand, too.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe slowdown is worse for fishers who use most of their catch to feed their families and sell a little extra, he said. “That small income every day maintains their house and their family and their school and children.\"\n\nThere are also special risks for women producers, said Davis and Campbell, many of whom are heads of household who support their children with the small amounts they sell.\n\nCompounding crises in Cuba and Haiti\n\nCuba and Haiti face similar challenges, exacerbated by their political and economic crises.\n\nThe storm unleashed terrible flooding in southern Haiti and is blamed for 31 deaths in the country, where hunger was already rising.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCastro of the World Food Program said the organization is concerned about the impact to some of Haiti's female producers, from whom the WFP typically buys produce to supply local schools.\n\n“We may need to bring food from other parts of the country if available or even having to import,” said Castro.\n\nIn Cuba, the evacuation of 735,000 people meant the country suffered no known deaths, but Melissa’s passage could worsen challenges in feeding Cubans. The country faces a severe economic crisis and spends some $2 billion annually importing food products.\n\nLocal officials said there was damage to plantain, corn and cassava crops, coffee, various vegetables and trees across the five affected eastern provinces.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGovernment officials said Melissa’s heavy rainfall did benefit dams and reservoirs, after the eastern part of the country had been suffering from a severe drought and water shortage.\n\n“That is one of the silver linings,” said Margarita Fernandez, executive director of the Caribbean Agroecology Institute in Vermont. CAI is raising funds to send directly to farmers and cooperatives there. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization also delivered seed to Cuba ahead of the storm, a spokesperson said.\n\nHelp arrives in phases\n\nRelief efforts across the northern Caribbean are focused on immediate needs for now, as first responders and humanitarian organizations provide shelter, health care, food and clean water, and restore power and communications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFood producers will soon need cash to make up for lost income, help replacing equipment and animals as well as new seed.\n\nThe Jamaican government keeps reserve funds, parametric insurance policies and catastrophe bonds for disasters. The government and nonprofits helped farmers and fishers after Hurricane Beryl replace what they lost.\n\nBut it can take a long time for that help to reach small scale producers, said Campbell.\n\nWith airports open again, Davis is looking for a flight to get back to White House. He needs to fix his boat, and his roof, but he doesn't know when he will sell fish again.\n\n“My worry is about when will the economy will be back to normal, where life goes on as it was before,” said Davis. “Everyone is picking up the pieces.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Andrea Rodríguez contributed reporting from Havana."

The report found that India recorded an average of 19.8 heatwave days last year, of which 6.6 days would not have occurred without human-induced climate change. It also estimated that heat exposure in 2024 resulted in the loss of 247 billion potential labour hours, mostly in the agriculture and construction sectors. amounting to an economic loss of about $194bn (£151bn). While heatwaves are not new to India, their frequency and intensity have been rising steadily over the past few decades because of global warming.\n\nProlonged exposure to extreme heat has serious repercussions on health. It can overwhelm the body's ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of dehydration, heatstroke, cardiovascular stress, and even death - particularly among the elderly, infants and outdoor workers. And the 2025 Lancet Countdown report - which tracks the health impact of climate change and is widely regarded as a key scientific reference on the issue - warns that the health risks posed by rising global temperatures are now more severe than ever. \"Throughout last year,152 record-breaking extreme weather events were registered across 61 countries, and life-threatening, extreme heat events are becoming more intense than previously predicted,\" the report stated. \"The climate crisis is a health crisis. Every fraction of a degree of warming costs lives and livelihoods,\" said Jeremy Farrar, assistant director-general for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care at the World Health Organization (WHO). The report found that heat-related mortality has increased by 23% worldwide since the 1990s, with an average of around 546,000 deaths each year.\n\nReuters India is among the most polluted countries in the world\n\nIt also found that the average person worldwide was exposed to 16 days of extreme heat last year that would not have occurred without climate change. \"This [report] paints a bleak and undeniable picture of the devastating health harms reaching all corners of the world,\" said Dr Marina Romanello, of University College London, who led the report's analysis. \"The destruction to lives and livelihoods will continue to escalate until we end our fossil fuel addiction,\" she added.\n\nAir Quality"

The most populous part of the country, the capital Kingston, missed the brunt of the storm. The government says the international airport could reopen for relief flights as early as tomorrow. Meanwhile, the storm is battering the west coast of Cuba.\n\ntoggle caption Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\n🎧 More than half a million people are without power, and every region of Jamaica is facing blocked roads and downed power lines, according to the country's government. NPR's Eyder Peralta tells Up First that the biggest concern for the country currently is Western Jamaica, which was severely impacted when the storm made landfall with winds reaching 185 miles per hour and generated a storm surge of up to 13 feet. Desmond McKenzie, the minister of local government, said St. Elizabeth Parish is underwater and numerous families are trapped in their homes. McKenzie says rescue teams are hoping that they can get to those families today, and people are still alive.\n\nand downed power lines, according to the country's government.

The military says it was dismantling a Hamas tunnel in an area of Gaza where Israeli troops were stationed when militants opened fire, killing a soldier. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered immediate \"forceful strikes\" in Gaza. Gaza Civil Defense reports that the strikes killed about 100 Palestinians, including around 35 children. Israel says it killed 30 militants in the strikes.\n\n\n\n🎧 The strikes were one of the single deadliest 24-hour periods in Gaza, even deadlier than some of the days of war, according to NPR's Daniel Estrin. The ceasefire was back on as of 10 a.m. local time today in Israel. The dispute over the search for Israeli hostage bodies that remain in Gaza threatens to impact the fragile ceasefire. Israel has been considering limiting aid to Gaza to pressure Hamas to hand over the bodies more quickly.\n\nAir traffic controllers say working without pay this week due to the government shutdown is making a difficult job even harder. Maximilian Crawford, a controller at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, states that many controllers are living paycheck to paycheck and are now seeking financial assistance from loans or family members. The shutdown has disrupted flights across the U.S., and there is currently no end in sight.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n🎧 The controllers' union says many workers have turned to gig work, like driving for Uber or DoorDash, to make money. Though these workers are in the minority, it is adding stress to controllers. There have been isolated delays seen at U.S. airports due to staffing shortages, but overall these delays are generally in line with what's normal outside of the shutdown, NPR's Joel Rose says. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said yesterday that while many air traffic controllers can make it without their first paycheck, nearly all of them cannot manage without two. Even before the shutdown there was a shortage of air traffic controllers, so it doesn't take a big increase in sick calls to impact the fragile system, Rose says.\n\nDeep dive\n\ntoggle caption Dobrila Vignjevic/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThe obesity rate among U.S. adults has declined to 37% this year, down from a high of 39.9% three years ago, according to a new survey by the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index. The data indicate that GLP-1 weight loss drugs are having an impact. The number of Americans using injectable obesity treatments has doubled over the past year and a half. GLP-1 agonists, as the new treatments are known, were first approved for obesity treatment in the U.S. in 2021. Here's what is known about how the drugs' usage is bringing down the U.S. obesity rate:\n\n\n\n💪 Since the drugs have been introduced to the market, obesity rates have declined significantly among people between ages 40 and 64. This correlates with a higher reliance on GLP-1 medications.\n\n💪 The drugs have been a game-changer for patients with obesity, but access to them has been limited and is likely to become a bigger issue. Many private insurers are halting coverage for GLP-1 medications next year, which will make them a costly option for weight maintenance.\n\n💪 Drugmakers are working on bringing potentially less-expensive pill options to the market, but it still might not be the fix needed to make it more accessible for many people.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRead more about what the survey discovered.\n\nLife advice\n\nKristen Uroda for NPR\n\nWhen someone you know has cancer, it can be challenging to figure out how to support them effectively. One of the best ways to be present for your loved one is by considering what you are good at and how you can help them in their time of need. Life Kit has compiled a list of roles that friends and family members can take on to help someone with cancer. Each role addresses a critical need that a cancer patient may have.\n\n\n\n❤️ If you are organized and detail-oriented, you could be a good doctor's appointment buddy. This role is also good for someone with a medical background. This person could have a prepared list of questions, take the lead during appointments.\n\n❤️ If you are comfortable with physical touch, don't mind sitting in silence or possibly have a good comedy routine, you could make a great procedure pal and patient advocate. You can go with your loved one to their scans, surgeries and radiation and chemotherapy appointments. This role focuses less on asking questions and more on providing emotional and physical support.\n\n❤️ If you are good at planning and willing to take initiative, you could be a great household helper and meal planner. Try offering to bring over dinner or coordinating with friends who can help with different activities. Instead of asking, offer to do a specific task like laundry.\n\nFor tips on how to support a loved one through cancer treatment, listen to this episode of NPR's Life Kit.

        "content": "Hurricane Melissa leaves trail of destruction across Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica\n\ntoggle caption Ramon Espinosa/AP\n\nSANTIAGO DE CUBA, Cuba — Hurricane Melissa left at least dozens dead and caused widespread destruction across Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica, where roofless homes, toppled utility poles and water-logged furniture dominated the landscape Wednesday.\n\nA landslide blocked the main roads of Santa Cruz in Jamaica's St. Elizabeth parish, where the streets were reduced to mud pits. Residents swept water from homes as they tried to salvage belongings. Wind ripped off part of the roof at a high school that serves as a public shelter.\n\n\"I never see anything like this before in all my years living here,\" resident Jennifer Small said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe extent of the damage from the deadly hurricane was unclear Wednesday as widespread power outages and dangerous conditions persisted in the region.\n\n\"It is too early for us to say definitively,\" said Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister.\n\nMelissa made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph (295 kph), one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, before weakening and moving on to Cuba, but even countries outside the direct path of the massive storm felt its devastating effects.\n\nAt least 25 people have died across Haiti and 18 are missing, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement Wednesday. Twenty of those reported dead and 10 of the missing are from a southern coastal town where flooding collapsed dozens of homes. At least eight are dead in Jamaica.\n\nIn Cuba, officials reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads and roofs blown off buildings Wednesday, with the heaviest destruction concentrated in the southwest and northwest. Authorities said about 735,000 people remained in shelters.\n\n\"That was hell. All night long, it was terrible,\" said Reinaldo Charon in Santiago de Cuba. The 52-year-old was one of the few people venturing out Wednesday, covered by a plastic sheet in the intermittent rain.\n\nForecasters expect Melissa, now a Category 1 hurricane, to bring dangerous winds, flooding and storm surge to the Bahamas on Wednesday night.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nJamaica rushes to assess the damage\n\nIn Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dixon said 77% of the island was without power.\n\nThe outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.\n\n\"Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement. \"Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly.\"\n\nOfficials in Black River, Jamaica, a southwestern coastal town of approximately 5,000 people, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing,\" Mayor Richard Solomon said.\n\nSolomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm. The hospital, police units and emergency services were inundated by floods and unable to conduct emergency operations.\n\nJamaican Transportation Minister Daryl Vaz said two of the island's airports will reopen Wednesday to relief flights only, with U.N. agencies and dozens of nonprofits on standby to distribute basic goods.\n\ntoggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP\n\n\"The devastation is enormous,\" he said. \"We need all hands on deck to recover stronger and to help those in need at this time.\"\n\nThe United States is sending rescue and response teams to assist in recovery efforts in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X.\n\nSt. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto told Nationwide News Network on Wednesday that authorities have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. One death was reported in the west when a tree fell on a baby, state minister Abka Fitz-Henley told Nationwide News Network.\n\nBefore landfall, Melissa had already been blamed for three deaths in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMelissa devastates Haitian town\n\nHurricane Melissa damaged more than 160 homes and destroyed 80 others in the town of Petit-Goâve, where 10 of the 20 people killed there were children, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday.\n\nLawyer Charly Saint-Vil, 30, said he saw bodies lying among the debris after the storm as he walked the streets of the small coastal town where he grew up. People screamed as they searched for their missing children, he said.\n\n\"People have lost everything,\" Saint-Vil said.\n\nAlthough the immediate threat of the storm has passed, Saint-Vil said Petit-Goâve's residents were living in fear about access to medicine, water and food in the coming days given the political instability in Haiti.\n\n\"We don't know what will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nFor now, neighbors are helping one another source necessities and find places to sleep. Saint-Vil is hosting a number of friends who lost their homes in his small apartment.\n\n\"What I can do, I will do it, but it's not easy because the situation is really complicated for everyone,\" he said.\n\nCuba rides out the storm\n\nPeople in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier.\n\n\"Life is what matters,\" Alexis Ramos, a 54-year-old fisherman, said as he surveyed his destroyed home and shielded himself from the intermittent rain with a yellow raincoat. \"Repairing this costs money, a lot of money.\"\n\nLocal media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground.\n\n\"As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery. We are ready,\" President Miguel Díaz-Canel wrote on X.\n\nThe hurricane could worsen Cuba's severe economic crisis, which already has led to prolonged power blackouts along with fuel and food shortages.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCuba's National Institute of Hydraulic Resources reported accumulated rainfall of 15 inches (38 centimeters) in Charco Redondo and 14 inches (36 centimeters) in Las Villas Reservoir.\n\nWednesday night Melissa had top sustained winds of 90 mph (150 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 16 mph (26 kph) according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. The hurricane was centered about 65 miles (100 kilometers) east of the central Bahamas and about 860 miles (1,385 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda.\n\nAuthorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago's southeast corner ahead of Melissa's arrival.\n\nMelissa's center is forecast to move through southeastern Bahamas later Wednesday, generating up to 7 feet (2 meters) of storm surge in the area. By late Thursday, Melissa is expected to pass just west of Bermuda."
