A month later, when a senior staff at Blue [Origin] called me, I had to hang up on him because I could not speak through my tears.\"\n\nMs Nyugen, who has worked as a scientist researching women's health and conducted numerous experiments during the Blue Origin flight, said everything she \"had worked for - as a scientist, my women's health research, the years I had trained for this moment, the experiments I operated in space, the history that was being made as the first Vietnamese woman astronaut, on the 50th anniversary of the US-Vietnam war, as the child of boat refugees, the promise I kept to my survivor self [...] were buried under an avalanche of misogyny\".\n\nMs Nguyen is most recognised for her work protecting the civil rights of sexual assault survivors.\n\nShe put her own ambition to become an astronaut on hold after being raped while at university and pursuing a years-long campaign for justice, she told the Guardian in an interview in March.\n\nEight months on from realising her dream, she said the \"fog of grief has started to lift\", and thanked those who have followed her and sent her good wishes. \"You all saved me\", she said.\n\nShe added that despite the backlash, \"there has been overwhelming good that has come out of [the flight]\", listing the media attention brought to her women's health research and opportunities to meet world leaders in relation to her advocacy work.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard rocket lifted off from its Texas launch site in April and took the six-woman crew on an 11-minute flight which crossed the internationally recognised boundary of space.\n\nThe crew also included aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe and film producer Kerianne Flynn.\n\nThe New Shepard rocket does not require human operation and is fully automated.\n\nBlue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon."

If there is a fire in the area, users will be notified and can go into an emergency mode that lets them share videos from their Ring cameras to the feed about that specific fire on Watch Duty’s platform.\n\nCourtesy of Ring\n\nIt's not a posting free-for-all; Watch Duty says it will choose which Ring videos to show in Fire Watch, based on relevance. Ring says Fire Watch will roll out to Neighborhood app users this spring.\n\nThe announcement comes at the one year anniversary of the 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles, which leveled entire neighborhoods, caused billions of dollars in damage, killed 30 people in the flames, and led to more than 400 deaths in total.\n\nWatch Duty, which lets users track wildfires and receive minute-by-minute updates about a blaze’s path and perimeter, became something of a lifeline for desperate LA residents looking for timely fire information. The mobile app saw 2.5 million new downloads during the LA fires and was widely hailed as a necessary resource.\n\nOne newfound Watch Duty user was Jamie Siminoff, the founder of Ring. While not at Ring at the time, he later rejoined the company after the Palisades fire burned his garage and parts of the back of his house. The experience of searching for information about where the fire was made him think that the Ring cameras all around him should have helped.\n\n“While I'm in it, I thought, why are we not doing this? And why are we not doing that?” Siminoff says. “A big part of why I wanted to come back was to do things like this with the Ring network and with our Ring customers.”\n\nFire Watch gets its real-time fire alerts from Watch Duty, and the feature notifies Neighbors users if a fire is nearby. There is also a feature to accept “voluntary community contributions” that lets Ring users opt in to sharing shots from their smart-home cameras with Watch Duty.\n\nCourtesy of Ring Courtesy of Ring\n\n“When you go into this mode, you'll get an alert as a Ring customer saying there's a massive fire in your area, basically, and would you like to assist Watch Duty with this?” Siminoff says. “You’re basically opening up your camera for the next 24 hours to donate your data.”\n\nThis is not the first third-party service Watch Duty has partnered with. It currently pulls map and fire perimeter information from official emergency services, then collates and regularly updates the information into an easily digestible feed on its app. Alert Wildfire, a service that powers a network of video cameras to spot fires, allows its videos to be included in Watch Duty’s reported feeds about individual fires. Watch Duty volunteers and users can also reach out individually to share their videos or photos."

Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days. The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at \"catastrophic\" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed. One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most \"significant\" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires.\n\nOn Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported. Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C. In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days. Friday will be the \"real peak of the current burst of heat,\" Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC. \"It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania\". Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said. \"Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow,\" Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria. \"This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020,\" Hines said. That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and tens of millions of hectares of land was burnt."

        "content": "Since Donald Trump regained the U.S. presidency, he has talked about taking over Greenland. He has insisted that the U.S. will control the island, currently an autonomous territory of Denmark, and that if his overtures are rejected he will perhaps seize Greenland by force. That idea was back in the news again in early 2026 and drawing international condemnation.\n\nWhen Congress held a hearing on Greenland’s importance to the U.S. in 2025, senators and expert witnesses had focused on the island’s strategic value and its natural resources: critical minerals, fossil fuels and hydropower. No one mentioned the hazards, many of them exacerbated by human-induced climate change, that those longing to possess and develop the island will inevitably encounter.\n\nThat’s imprudent, because the Arctic’s climate is changing more rapidly than anywhere on Earth. Such rapid warming further increases the already substantial economic and personal risk for those living, working and extracting resources on Greenland, and for the rest of the planet.\n\nI am a geoscientist who studies the environmental history of Greenland and its ice sheet, including natural hazards and climate change. That knowledge is essential for understanding the risks that military and extractive efforts face on Greenland today and in the future.\n\nGreenland: Land of extremes\n\nGreenland is unlike where most people live. The climate is frigid. For much of the year, sea ice clings to the coast, making it inaccessible.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAn ice sheet, up to 2 miles thick, covers more than 80% of the island. The population, about 56,000 people, lives along the island’s steep, rocky coastline.\n\nWhile researching my book “When the Ice is Gone,” I discovered how Greenland’s harsh climate and vast wilderness stymied past colonial endeavors. During World War II, dozens of U.S. military pilots, disoriented by thick fog and running out of fuel, crashed onto the ice sheet. An iceberg from Greenland sunk the Titanic in 1912, and 46 years later, another sunk a Danish vessel specifically designed to fend off ice, killing all 95 aboard.\n\nNow amplified by climate change, natural hazards make resource extraction and military endeavors in Greenland uncertain, expensive and potentially deadly.\n\nRock on the move\n\nGreenland’s coastal landscape is prone to rockslides. The hazard arises because the coast is where people live and where rock isn’t hidden under the ice sheet. In some places, that rock contains critical minerals, such as gold, as well as other rare metals used for technology, including for circuit boards and electrical vehicle batteries.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe unstable slopes reflect how the ice sheet eroded the deep fjords when it was larger. Now that the ice has melted, nothing buttresses the near-vertical valley walls, and so, they collapse.\n\nIn 2017, a northwestern Greenland mountainside fell 3,000 feet into the deep waters of the fjord below. Moments later, the wave that rockfall generated (a tsunami) washed over the nearby villages of Nuugaatsiaq and Illorsuit. The water, laden with icebergs and sea ice, ripped homes from their foundations as people and sled dogs ran for their lives. By the time it was over, four people were dead and both villages lay in ruin.\n\nSteep fjord walls around the island are littered with the scars of past rockslides. The evidence shows that at one point in the last 10,000 years, one of those slides dropped rock sufficient to fill 3.2 million Olympic swimming pools into the water below. In 2023, another rockslide triggered a tsunami that sloshed back and forth for nine days in a Greenland fjord.\n\nThere’s no network of paved roads across Greenland. The only feasible way to move heavy equipment, minerals and fossil fuels would be by sea. Docks, mines and buildings within tens of feet of sea level would be vulnerable to rockslide-induced tsunamis.\n\nMelting ice will be deadly and expensive\n\nHuman-induced global warming, driven by fossil fuel combustion, speeds the melting of Greenland’s ice. That melting is threatening the island’s infrastructure and the lifestyles of native people, who over millennia have adapted their transportation and food systems to the presence of snow and ice. Record floods, fed by warmth-induced melting of the ice sheet, have recently swept away bridges that stood for half a century.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs the climate warms, permafrost – frozen rock and soil – which underlies the island, thaws. This destabilizes the landscape, weakening steep slopes and damaging critical infrastructure.\n\nPermafrost melt is already threatening the U.S. military base on Greenland. As the ice melts and the ground settles under runways, cracks and craters form – a hazard for airplanes. Buildings tilt as their foundations settle into the softening soil, including critical radar installations that have scanned the skies for missiles and bombers since the 1950s.\n\nGreenland’s icebergs can threaten oil rigs. As the warming climate speeds the flow of Greenland’s glaciers, they calve more icebergs in the ocean. The problem is worse close to Greenland, but some icebergs drift toward Canada, endangering oil rigs there. Ships stand guard, ready to tow threatening icebergs away.\n\nGreenland’s government banned drilling for fossil fuels in 2021 out of concern for the environment. Yet, Trump and his allies remain eager to see exploration resume off the island, despite exceptionally high costs, less than stellar results from initial drilling, and the ever-present risk of icebergs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs Greenland’s ice melts and water flows into the ocean, sea level changes, but in ways that might not be intuitive. Away from the island, sea level is rising about an inch each six years. But close to the ice sheet, it’s the land that’s rising. Gradually freed of the weight of its ice, the rock beneath Greenland, long depressed by the massive ice sheet, rebounds. That rise is rapid – more than 6 feet per century. Soon, many harbors in Greenland may become too shallow for ship traffic.\n\nStreams of meltwater flow over the silt-covered surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet as it melts in summer heat near Kangerlussuaq in western Greenland. REDA/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nGreenland’s challenging past and future\n\nHistory clearly shows that many past military and colonial endeavors failed in Greenland because they showed little consideration of the island’s harsh climate and dynamic ice sheet.\n\nChanging climate drove Norse settlers out of Greenland 700 years ago. Explorers trying to cross the ice sheet lost their lives to the cold. American bases built inside the ice sheet, such as Camp Century, were quickly crushed as the encasing snow deformed.\n\nIn the past, the American focus in Greenland was on short-term gains with little regard for the future. Abandoned U.S. military bases from World War II, scattered around the island and in need of cleanup, are one example. Forced relocation of Greenlandic Inuit communities during the Cold War is another. I believe that Trump’s demands today for American control of the island to exploit its resources are similarly shortsighted.\n\nPiles of rusting fuel drums sit at an abandoned U.S. base from World War II in Ikateq, in eastern Greenland. Posnov/Moment via Getty Images\n\nHowever, when it comes to the planet’s livability, I’ve argued that the greatest strategic and economic value of Greenland to the world is not its location or its natural resources, but its ice. That white snow and ice reflect sunlight, keeping Earth cool. And the ice sheet, perched on land, keeps water out of the ocean. As it melts, Greenland’s ice sheet will raise global sea level, up to about 23 feet when all the ice is gone.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nClimate-driven sea level rise is already flooding coastal regions around the world, including major economic centers. As that continues, estimates suggest that the damage will total trillions of dollars. Unless Greenland’s ice remains frozen, coastal inundation will force the largest migration that humanity has ever witnessed. Such changes are predicted to destabilize the global economic and strategic world order.\n\nThese examples show that disregarding the risks of natural hazards and climate change in Greenland courts disaster, both locally and globally.\n\nThis article, originally published Feb. 19, 2025, has been updated with new U.S. attention to Greenland.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.
