A month later, when a senior staff at Blue [Origin] called me, I had to hang up on him because I could not speak through my tears.\"\n\nMs Nyugen, who has worked as a scientist researching women's health and conducted numerous experiments during the Blue Origin flight, said everything she \"had worked for - as a scientist, my women's health research, the years I had trained for this moment, the experiments I operated in space, the history that was being made as the first Vietnamese woman astronaut, on the 50th anniversary of the US-Vietnam war, as the child of boat refugees, the promise I kept to my survivor self [...] were buried under an avalanche of misogyny\".\n\nMs Nguyen is most recognised for her work protecting the civil rights of sexual assault survivors.\n\nShe put her own ambition to become an astronaut on hold after being raped while at university and pursuing a years-long campaign for justice, she told the Guardian in an interview in March.\n\nEight months on from realising her dream, she said the \"fog of grief has started to lift\", and thanked those who have followed her and sent her good wishes. \"You all saved me\", she said.\n\nShe added that despite the backlash, \"there has been overwhelming good that has come out of [the flight]\", listing the media attention brought to her women's health research and opportunities to meet world leaders in relation to her advocacy work.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard rocket lifted off from its Texas launch site in April and took the six-woman crew on an 11-minute flight which crossed the internationally recognised boundary of space.\n\nThe crew also included aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe and film producer Kerianne Flynn.\n\nThe New Shepard rocket does not require human operation and is fully automated.\n\nBlue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon."

        "content": "Indonesians raise white flags as anger grows over slow flood aid\n\n25 December 2025 Share Save Kelly Ng , Singapore , Riana Ibrahim , BBC Indonesian, Jakarta and Raja Eben Lumbanrau , BBC Indonesian, Jakarta Share Save\n\nAFP via Getty Images People in Indonesia's Aceh province are raising white flags as a call for international solidarity\n\nFor weeks now, angry and distressed residents in Indonesia's westernmost province have been raising white flags over the state's slow response to a series of deadly floods. Triggered by a rare cyclone in November, the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. \"Does the central government not know [what we're experiencing]? I don't understand,\" a tearful Ismail A Jalil said in front of cameras. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is \"under control\". \"Indonesia is capable of overcoming this disaster,\" he told his cabinet last week. Prabowo has also ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts.\n\nPrabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he won in February 2024 on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over mass food poisonings. In August and September, thousands of Indonesians took to the streets over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Many in Aceh still do not have ready access to clean water, food and electricity\n\nDesperate calls for help\n\nLast Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: \"I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world.\" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. \"The flags do not mean we are giving in. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,\" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, told the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. Survivors have spoken of sickness and starvation. \"How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,\" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring that he welcomes help \"from anyone, anywhere\". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a \"national scale\", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts.\n\nDisaster strikes again\n\nFor some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. Aceh, already ravaged by decades of civil war, was among the hardest-hit. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects. \"Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added. Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods - but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government.\n\nGetty Images Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch"

If there is a fire in the area, users will be notified and can go into an emergency mode that lets them share videos from their Ring cameras to the feed about that specific fire on Watch Duty’s platform.\n\nCourtesy of Ring\n\nIt's not a posting free-for-all; Watch Duty says it will choose which Ring videos to show in Fire Watch, based on relevance. Ring says Fire Watch will roll out to Neighborhood app users this spring.\n\nThe announcement comes at the one year anniversary of the 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles, which leveled entire neighborhoods, caused billions of dollars in damage, killed 30 people in the flames, and led to more than 400 deaths in total.\n\nWatch Duty, which lets users track wildfires and receive minute-by-minute updates about a blaze’s path and perimeter, became something of a lifeline for desperate LA residents looking for timely fire information. The mobile app saw 2.5 million new downloads during the LA fires and was widely hailed as a necessary resource.\n\nOne newfound Watch Duty user was Jamie Siminoff, the founder of Ring. While not at Ring at the time, he later rejoined the company after the Palisades fire burned his garage and parts of the back of his house. The experience of searching for information about where the fire was made him think that the Ring cameras all around him should have helped.\n\n“While I'm in it, I thought, why are we not doing this? And why are we not doing that?” Siminoff says. “A big part of why I wanted to come back was to do things like this with the Ring network and with our Ring customers.”\n\nFire Watch gets its real-time fire alerts from Watch Duty, and the feature notifies Neighbors users if a fire is nearby. There is also a feature to accept “voluntary community contributions” that lets Ring users opt in to sharing shots from their smart-home cameras with Watch Duty.\n\nCourtesy of Ring Courtesy of Ring\n\n“When you go into this mode, you'll get an alert as a Ring customer saying there's a massive fire in your area, basically, and would you like to assist Watch Duty with this?” Siminoff says. “You’re basically opening up your camera for the next 24 hours to donate your data.”\n\nThis is not the first third-party service Watch Duty has partnered with. It currently pulls map and fire perimeter information from official emergency services, then collates and regularly updates the information into an easily digestible feed on its app. Alert Wildfire, a service that powers a network of video cameras to spot fires, allows its videos to be included in Watch Duty’s reported feeds about individual fires. Watch Duty volunteers and users can also reach out individually to share their videos or photos."

Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days. The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at \"catastrophic\" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed. One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most \"significant\" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires.\n\nOn Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported. Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C. In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days. Friday will be the \"real peak of the current burst of heat,\" Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC. \"It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania\". Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said. \"Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow,\" Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria. \"This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020,\" Hines said. That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and tens of millions of hectares of land was burnt."
