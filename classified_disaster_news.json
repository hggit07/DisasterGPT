        "content": "Dozens dead in 'total devastation' left behind by Hurricane Melissa\n\n6 days ago Share Save Share Save\n\nGabriela Pomeroy and Nardine Saad\n\nHurricane Melissa floods and destroys towns across Caribbean including in Cuba, Jamaica and Haiti (pictured)\n\nHurricane Melissa has continued its devastating sweep across the Caribbean, destroying homes and infrastructure, flooding neighbourhoods and leaving dozens dead. The impact in Jamaica was clearer on Wednesday, after the island nation was hit squarely by the category five storm - one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the region. At least five people have been confirmed dead there. At least another 20 died during flooding in Haiti as Melissa, now a category two storm, tore through the region. In Jamaica, people remain stranded on roofs and without power. Prime Minister Andrew Holness noted the \"total devastation\" across the island-nation.\n\nHe added that \"80-90% of roofs were destroyed\", along with hospitals, libraries, police stations, port houses and other urban infrastructure. King Charles, who is the head of state in Jamaica, said in a statement that he was \"deeply concerned\" and \"profoundly saddened\" at the damage caused by Melissa in Jamaica and across the Caribbean. \"This most dreadful of record-breaking storms reminds us of the increasingly urgent need to restore the balance and harmony of Nature for the sake of all those whose lives and livelihoods may have been shattered by this heartbreaking disaster,\" he said.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Hurricane Melissa caused flooding and damage to buildings in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba\n\nFrom Jamaica, where the storm also caused mudslides, and palm trees to be tossed like toothpicks, Melissa moved north to Cuba as a category three storm, bringing 115 mph winds and heavy rain, and battering the south-east of the island. How do hurricanes form and are they getting stronger?\n\nWhat makes Melissa such a dangerous storm?\n\n'We are all terrified', say locals in path of Hurricane Melissa Rovier Mesa Rodríguez, a video maker who lives in Santiago de Cuba, called the storm \"terrifying\" and described it sounding \"like a tornado\". Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel asked residents to \"not let their guard down\" and said that the country had prepared for a worst-case scenario, which helped its response. On Wednesday night, the storm was 105 miles (170km) from the central Bahamas and expected to reach the Bahamas region overnight. Hurricane Melissa was moving north-east with wind speeds at 100 mph (155 km/h). A dangerous storm surge is expected there before it moves further north toward Bermuda. A tropical storm warning is in place for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the speed of the slow-moving hurricane is expected to increase in the coming days.\n\nHurricane Melissa - what we know about the damage in Jamaica\n\nIn Jamaica, three men and a woman were confirmed dead. They were discovered after being washed up by the flood waters in the storm, said Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica's minister of Local Government and Community Development. About three-quarters of the country lost electricity overnight. Richard Vernon, mayor of Montego Bay, told the BBC that half of the city had been cut off from the other by floods. He said the priority was to \"check if everybody is alive\". A resident in St Elizabeth sheltering in her four-bedroom home described the moment her roof blew off. Gordon Swaby, a businessman in Kingston, told the BBC that his first cousin's house was completely destroyed. His cousin - who he declined to be named - recently moved from the United States to her \"dream\" house by the sea in the upscale Crane Road area. She lost the entire concrete structure and everything in it. \"She wanted a different kind of life,\" Gordon said. \"She chose the area because she loves the sea, so this is really devastating.\" Devastation was evident on Wednesday across central Jamaica. The city of Mandeville was flattened and the main road through town was littered with debris. Foliage was stuck to everything, and bits of building material were scattered along the road. The clean-up is expected to take months. Pia Chevallier, who is on holiday in Jamaica, said she felt \"sick with worry\" during the storm overnight. \"The windows didn't stop vibrating.\"\n\nWatch: Strong winds and flying debris as Hurricane Melissa makes landfall in Jamaica"

        "content": "Mystery heatwave warms Pacific Ocean to new record\n\n17 October 2025 Share Save Mark Poynting and Matt McGrath BBC News Climate and Science Share Save\n\nKevin Carter/Getty Images People head to the coast in San Diego on a hot summer's day\n\nThe waters of the north Pacific have had their warmest summer on record, according to BBC analysis of a mysterious marine heatwave that has confounded climate scientists. Sea surface temperatures between July and September were more than 0.25C above the previous high of 2022 - a big increase across an area roughly ten times the size of the Mediterranean. While climate change is known to make marine heatwaves more likely, scientists are struggling to explain why the north Pacific has been so hot for so long. But all this extra heat in the so-called \"warm blob\" may have the opposite effect in the UK, possibly making a colder start to winter more likely, some researchers believe.\n\n\"There's definitely something unusual going on in the north Pacific,\" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US. Such a jump in temperatures across a region so large is \"quite remarkable\", he added. The BBC analysed data from the European Copernicus climate service to calculate average temperatures between July and September across a large area of the north Pacific, sometimes known as the \"warm blob\". The region extends from the east coast of Asia to the west coast of North America, the same area used in previous scientific studies. The figures show that not only has the region been warming quickly over the past couple of decades, but 2025 is markedly higher than recent years too.\n\nThat the seas are getting hotter is no surprise. Global warming, caused by humanity's emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, has already trebled the number of days of extreme heat in oceans globally, according to research published earlier this year. But temperatures have been even higher than most climate models - computer simulations taking into account humanity's carbon emissions - had predicted. Analysis of these models by the Berkeley Earth group suggests that sea temperatures observed across the north Pacific in August had less than a 1% chance of occurring in any single year. Natural weather variability is thought to be part of the reason. This summer has seen weaker-than-usual winds, for example. That means more heat from the summer sunshine can stay in the sea surface, rather than being mixed with cooler waters below. But this can only go so far in explaining the exceptional conditions, according to Dr Hausfather. \"It certainly is not just natural variability,\" he said. \"There's something else going on here as well.\"\n\nOne intriguing idea is that a recent change to shipping fuels might be contributing to the warming. Prior to 2020, dirty engine oil produced large amounts of sulphur dioxide, a gas harmful to human health. But that sulphur also formed tiny, Sun-reflecting particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols, which helped to keep a lid on rising temperatures. So removing that cooling effect in shipping hotspots like the north Pacific could be revealing the full impact of human-caused warming. \"It does seem like sulphur is the primary candidate for what's driving this warming in the region,\" said Dr Hausfather. Other research suggests that efforts to reduce air pollution in Chinese cities has played a role in warming the Pacific too. That dirty air did a similar job to shipping in reflecting sunlight away, while cleaning it up could have had the unintended consequence of allowing more ocean heating.\n\nPossible impacts for the UK?\n\nThe north Pacific's marine heatwave has already had consequences for weather on both sides of the Pacific, likely boosting very high summer temperatures in Japan and South Korea and storms in the US. \"In California, we've seen supercharged thunderstorms because the warm ocean waters in the Pacific provide heat and moisture,\" said Amanda Maycock, professor in climate dynamics at the University of Leeds. \"In particular, there are things we call atmospheric rivers… bands of air, which contain very high amounts of moisture that fuel themselves from the ocean waters,\" she added. \"So if we have warm ocean waters… they can then bring a lot of moisture onto the land, which then falls out as rain, or in the wintertime can precipitate out as snow.\"\n\nReuters The intense heat to hit Japan in August was likely amplified by Pacific Ocean heat, researchers say\n\nLong-term weather forecasting is always challenging, but extreme heat in the north Pacific has the potential to affect the UK and Europe in the coming months too. That's because of relationships between weather in different parts of the world known as teleconnections. \"Although the current warm conditions are located in the north Pacific, these can generate wave motions in the atmosphere that can alter our weather downstream into the north Atlantic and into Europe,\" said Prof Maycock. \"That can tend to favour high-pressure conditions over the continent, which brings us more of an influence from the Arctic, where we have colder air,\" she added. \"That can be drawn over Europe and bring us colder weather in early winter.\" A colder outcome is by no means certain, as this is a complex area of science. Several other weather patterns also affect UK winters, which are typically getting milder with climate change. And a warm north Pacific appears to have different effects later in the winter, favouring milder and wetter conditions in some parts of Europe.\n\nEmerging La Niña in the tropical Pacific\n\nAnother factor to throw into the mix is what's happening further south in the eastern tropical Pacific. There, surface waters are unusually cool - a classic sign of the weather phenomenon known as La Niña.\n\nLa Niña, and its warm sibling El Niño, are natural patterns, although research published this week highlighted that global warming could itself impact the swings between them. Weak La Niña conditions are expected to persist over the next few months, according to NOAA, the US science agency. All else being equal, La Niña generally increases the risk of a cold start to winter in the UK, but also brings a higher chance of a mild end, the Met Office says. \"These two drivers in the north and tropical Pacific will be acting together this winter,\" said Prof Maycock. \"But since the La Niña is quite weak this year, the extreme warmth in the north Pacific could be more important for forecasting the winter ahead.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Muskeen Liddar and Libby Rogers"

But the devastating impact of the Category 5 storm on communities is starting to be revealed by satellite imagery. BBC Verify has been examining the new images to try to piece together what has been destroyed and what has been left standing.\n\nBlack River\n\nArguably the most striking impact can be seen in images of the southwestern coastal port of Black River. We can identify specific buildings that have been battered or in some cases destroyed. By comparing a satellite image taken on 9 February with one taken on 29 October - after the hurricane hit - you can see that the distinctive white roof of a building housing a market has been replaced by a gaping hole. A little further north, a café has been wiped off the map. At the top of the image, the red roof of a warehouse has disappeared. The outline of the fire station next to the market is still visible but the top of the building appears to have been torn off. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has described Black River as \"ground zero\" after sharing footage of the destruction there.\n\nWhite House\n\nPhotographs of White House, a fishing village on the west coast of Jamaica which is home to several thousand people, reveal how it bore the brunt as Melissa made landfall with winds of up to 185 mph.\n\nNearly every structure appears to have been damaged or destroyed. In particular, the buildings next to the beach appear to have razed to the ground. These include restaurants called Marva's and Pelican Lookout. The top of a large circular structure is now missing and further inland, along the main road, a cluster of shops has been hit hard. Fishing boats in the bay - seen in satellite imagery on 7 October - have disappeared.\n\nMontego Bay"

With wind speeds of up to 175mph (282km/h), Hurricane Melissa is a category five storm - the maximum strength. It is intensifying and expected to make landfall on the Caribbean island early on Tuesday. It has been blamed for four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, in addition to the lives lost in Jamaica. Experts warn that Melissa's slow pace may mean prolonged torrential rain in some areas, increasing the risk of deadly flooding and landslides.\n\nFollow live updates The latest data from the US-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) shows that in terms of maximum wind and low central pressure, Melissa is the world's strongest storm so far this year. At its current strength, it would be the strongest hurricane to hit Jamaica since record-keeping began in 1851, CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reported. Tropical storm conditions are already occurring in Jamaica, and \"catastrophic and life-threatening hurricane-force wind conditions are expected to begin Tuesday morning,\" the latest NHC public advisory update said at 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT) on Monday.\n\nWatch: Satellite video shows Hurricane Melissa intensifying near Jamaica\n\nThree \"storm-related deaths\" were already reported in Jamaica Monday evening ahead of the hurricane's landfall, Jamaica's ministry of health and wellness said on X. The NHC said Melissa was currently about 140 miles (240km) south-west of the capital Kingston, with sustained winds of 175mph, (280km/h). It was moving \"north-northeast\" at 2mph (4 km/h). The update warned that within the eyewall - the inner part of the hurricane next to the eye, where wind speeds are typically the highest - \"total structural failure is likely\". It urged extra caution in Jamaica's \"higher elevation areas\", where wind speeds could be as much as 30% stronger. NHC director Michael Brennan warned Jamaicans: \"Do not venture outside with catastrophic life threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides expected through Tuesday.\" He advised not to \"go out in the eye as it passes over your area. The forward speed of Melissa is going to increase and the eye is going to start to move very quickly across the island.\" Forty inches of rain (100cm) was possible in parts of Jamaica over the next four days, according to the NHC. \"This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,\" said NHC deputy director Jamie Rhome. The Jamaican government has ordered evacuations for parts of Kingston. In a BBC interview, Jamaican Education Minister Dana Morris Dixon warned of an impending storm \"the likes of which we have never seen\". \"We've been having rain all of October. So the ground is already very saturated. And then to take that much rain means we're going to have flooding, extensive flooding and landslides in the mountainous areas,\" she told BBC Newshour. The minister added: \"We have 881 shelters. We have activated all our shelters. All of them are free.'' A Hurricane Hunter aircraft, which collects data in severe storms and informs forecasts on the pathway and intensity of hurricanes, was forced to abort a mission after experiencing severe turbulence, a spokesperson for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told CBS. Evadney Campbell, a Londoner currently visiting family on Jamaica's north coast, told the BBC: \"The house that I am in is hurricane proof. It is built with blocks and steel from top to bottom and is filled with concrete. \"We're checking on neighbours to see if they are OK. \"I am worried about people who live on the lowlands in parts of the south-east. Many do not want to leave their homes as they are worried about looting their houses,\" Ms Campbell said. Damian Anderson, a 47-year-old teacher from the mountainous town of Hagley Gap in the south-east, said impassable roads already had cut off his community. \"We can't move. We're scared,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.\n\nWatch: Jamaicans and Cubans prepare for Hurricane Melissa\n\nJamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has ordered the immediate evacuation of several vulnerable communities across the island. In a post on X, he urged \"every Jamaican to prepare, stay indoors during the storm, and comply with evacuation orders\". \"We will weather this storm and rebuild stronger,\" he wrote. \"You have been warned. It's now up to you to use that information to make the right decision,\" he said during a briefing, and told CNN, \"I don't believe there is any infrastructure within this region that could withstand a Category 5 storm, so there could be significant dislocation.\" In some rural areas, school buses were used to ferry vulnerable people to shelters and across the country.\n\nLater on Tuesday night, hurricane conditions are expected in Cuba, as well as tropical storm conditions in Haiti, according to the NHS report. The Bahamas will experience hurricane conditions on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions in the Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday. At least three people are already known to have died and hundreds of homes have been flooded in Haiti as Melissa brought torrential rainfall to the island of Hispaniola. In the Dominican Republic, located on the eastern side of Hispaniola, one person also died. Local media identified the victim as a 79-year-old man who had been swept away by floodwaters in the capital, Santo Domingo. A 13-year-old has also been reported missing after being dragged away by strong currents as he was swimming in the sea. Several people were rescued after being trapped in their cars by the rising floodwater.\n\nOrlando Barría/EPA/Shutterstock Heavy rains brought by Hurricane Melissa flooded neighbourhoods in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic"

The trekkers arrived in the small township of Qudang and surrounding areas, along with 300 local guides, yak handlers and other support staff, CCTV reported on Tuesday. A final group of around 10 hikers, accompanied by rescue workers, is yet to reach Qudang but has made it to a rendezvous point, which has heating equipment, oxygen and other emergency supplies. The tourists became stranded at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft) after heavy snowfall blocked their route up Everest's eastern slopes over the weekend.\n\nThe blizzard struck during China's eight-day Golden Week holiday, a peak season for local tourism. October usually provides clear skies and friendly temperatures, making it one of the favoured months to hike in the Mount Everest area. Hundreds of hikers made their way to the Karma Valley hiking trail, a lesser-known but scenic route to the base of Everest - which also offers a view of the world's highest peak. The heavy snowfall began on Friday evening, intensifying over the weekend, catching mountain guides off guard. One trekker, who had visited the Himalayas more than a dozen times, told the BBC he had \"never experienced weather like this\". Dong Shuchang, 27, said that several people in his group of 20 showed signs of hypothermia. Chen Geshuang, who was part of Mr Dong's hiking group, said the snow was about a metre deep when the group started their retreat on Sunday. \"All of us are experienced hikers,\" Ms Chen said. \"But this blizzard was still extremely difficult to deal with. I was so lucky to get out.\"\n\nWatch: Rescuers worked for days to recover hikers stranded by Mount Everest blizzard"

        "content": "24 hours with Trump on diplomatic tornado through Middle East\n\n14 October 2025 Share Save Tom Bateman State department correspondent travelling on Air Force One Share Save\n\nWatch: \"I'm talking about rebuilding Gaza\", Trump tells the BBC's Tom Bateman\n\nUS President Donald Trump's day-long trip to the Middle East came as the Gaza deal was clinched: an agreement coming into force amounting to one of the most critical moments yet after two years of catastrophic war. Painting as he does in primary colours, Trump's portrayal was vivid - of the biggest turning point in three millennia. On the return flight in the early hours of Tuesday, he reflected that it had been a \"historic day, to put it mildly\". He had earlier suggested \"everlasting peace\" had been grasped under his tutelage, in a region long convulsed by violence. As part of the White House press corps, we were travelling on Air Force One – which is how I found myself at the centre of this US diplomatic tornado. As we headed for Tel Aviv, the presidential plane took a turn to do a fly-by of the beach. It dipped a wing so we could get a view of a giant sign atop the sand that said \"thank you\" to Trump, and featured the Israeli flag as well as an outline of the US president's head in profile.\n\nReuters\n\nThe manoeuvre set the mood for a trip that was a victory lap, rather than an exercise in setting out the punishing detail for starting \"phase two\" of the negotiations and securing a longer-term future for Gaza. The agreement made in Doha last week was under intensive pressure on the sides from Trump. It marked one of the most profound moments for millions of people in the last two years: major combat operations in Gaza ceased, the remaining living hostages held by Hamas released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and Palestinians in Gaza returning to the ruins of their homes in the north amid a partial withdrawal by Israeli troops. But I found Trump's journey was in fact to a waypoint, not a destination - a fragile truce in a century-old conflict which shows no real signs of being solved.\n\nThe most immediate question hanging over the trip was whether Trump's deal could hold - and whether more intensive, arguably harder, negotiations could now build on it. During the flight, Trump came back to speak to us. Standing in the doorway as we crowded around, he clearly wanted to build up the sense of achievement, frequently referring to his own role in negotiating the deal. \"Every country is dancing in the streets,\" he said repeatedly. I pressed him on whether the ceasefire would stay intact. He was confident it would, saying there were \"a lot of reasons why it's going to hold\". But he glossed over the really big questions about what comes next, particularly how to secure and govern Gaza. I asked him about the proposed multinational force, or International Stabilization Force (ISF), outlined in his 20-point plan but whose existence has yet to be agreed by the sides. \"It's going to be a big, strong force,\" said Trump, adding that it would \"barely\" have to be used because \"people are going to behave, everybody knows their place\". On the tarmac in Tel Aviv, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greeted Trump with a red carpet and a military band. We then zoomed off in the motorcade towards Jerusalem, along the Route 1 motorway which had been completely cleared for the presidential convoy. The same day, thousands watched a giant screen in a public plaza in Tel Aviv that has become known as Hostages Square. They shed tears of joy and relief as the hostages were released by Hamas in Gaza. Trump's arrival was the other half of this split-screen moment – pictures were beamed out of the US president setting foot on Israeli territory.\n\nGetty Images Crowds in Tel Aviv watched side-by-side footage of the hostages' release and Trump's visit to Israel\n\nIn the chamber of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, the mood was altogether more raucous than that in the streets. Emblazoned on the red baseball caps handed out by staff, and worn by some of the audience, were the words: \"The president of peace\". Spectators shouted from the gallery behind me: \"Thank you Trump.\" Lawmakers hammered their desks. Trump hailed a \"historic dawn of a new Middle East\". He also wanted to leave little doubt that the war was over, and it seemed he expected it to stay that way: Israel, he said, with America's help, had won all that it could \"by force of arms\". His speech meandered into extensive attacks on his political opponents in the US. He praised a major donor to his election campaign seated in the gallery. And he even appealed to Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, sitting next to him, to pardon Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption – charges that the Israeli PM denies. \"Cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that?\" Trump exclaimed, referencing the allegation that Netanyahu accepted pricy gifts.\n\nWatch: Emotional reunions as freed hostages return to Israel\n\nThe White House press officers who chaperone the press pool - the \"wranglers\" - took us back into the media vans and the motorcade made its way back to Ben Gurion airport after fewer than seven hours in Israel. We took the short flight to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt; location of the mediated talks between Israel and Hamas that led to last week's breakthrough. On our descent, Egyptian F16s escorted us - the ultimate show for the president who loves displays of military might. Trump had wanted to celebrate every minute of the day. But the dangers in this region are many, and the risk seemed clear that he was declaring the ultimate deal before really landing it. That was reflected in the giant sign, written in capital letters, above the presidential podium in Sharm el-Sheikh: \"PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST\". There, I watched the extraordinary sight of world leaders filing into a room to stand behind Trump as he made his speech hailing peace. They lined up in front of their national flags and listened as he listed their countries one by one. Trump had been introduced to the stage by the host, Egyptian president Abdel Fatah el-Sisi, who said that the goal remained a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump has changed his position markedly since the start of this year. He became increasingly irritated by the Israeli leadership and was drawn closer to his friends in the Gulf. That came amid a diplomatic move by the Europeans to isolate Israel over its escalating campaign in Gaza and to get the Saudi leadership onboard with their vision. Trump then shifted, drawn by his Gulf allies – whose wealth and \"power\" he frequently referred to during the trip. Trump presided over the signing ceremony in Sharm saying it had taken \"3,000 years\" to get here. But there are still many more years to go - and it will take more than one man to get there.\n\nWatch: 'Indescribable happiness' as detainees return to Gaza"

        "content": "A popular ski resort town in Colorado is adopting a new AI Smart City Solution from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to help it better detect wildfires, as well as update a range of other city services.\n\nVail is expanding its firefighting toolbox as hotter, more arid weather with climate change raises wildfire risk in the western US. Colorado has suffered 11 of the 20 largest fires in state history just within the last five years. Researchers and first responders are increasingly exploring ways in which new AI tools might help them get ahead of blazes.\n\n“Fires are part of our life [now] in the mountains, and we have to be prepared for them,” Vail town manager Russell Forrest tells The Verge.\n\n“Fires are part of our life.”\n\nThe collaboration with HPE for wildfire detection came together quickly this year, as Forrest was keeping an eye on a wildfire burning about 30 miles away from his town in July. “One of the things that became very apparent with that fire is that rapid detection of the fire and then the response to that made a big difference and will continue to make a difference in terms of managing future fires where we are,” he says.\n\nForrest connected with HPE and the company Kamiwaza, which has developed an AI orchestration platform, to ask how AI might be able to help the town. Now, Vail is the first municipality in the US to adopt HPE’s new “smart city solution,“ developed alongside Kamiwaza, Nvidia, and several other tech companies.\n\nThe aim is to make it quicker and easier to analyze footage the town already takes using cameras placed on buses and high vantage points on the mountains. Until now, it was primarily people who analyzed those videos trying to spot signs of fire and sometimes being stymied by whether what they saw was smoke or fog. They might have to send people out to a place where there appeared to be a lightning strike to see if it had sparked a blaze.\n\nThe new AI-enhanced system can restore higher fidelity in the images if needed and then apply video analytics against it, HPE vice president of AI and hybrid cloud business development Robin Braun explains. It’s been trained to identify lightning strikes and smoke in real time. On the agentic back end, the Kamiwaza platform adds additional context like weather indications (has it been snowing lately or is there a red flag warning in effect?) that might indicate how serious of an event this is and how to respond.\n\nIn addition, geospatial data analysis provided by Blackshark.ai is also incorporated into the smart city system. It can utilize drone and satellite images to assess how dry or healthy vegetation is as a measure of fire risk, as well as see how close fire-prone brush is to homes to figure out what needs to be cleared.\n\nVail isn’t alone in testing out new AI tools for fire detection. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has developed an experimental Next Generation Fire System (NGFS) to automate fire detection from satellite imagery. It searches for heat anomalies to detect fires and then sends alerts through an online dashboard that debuted in February to keep first responders and other officials informed.\n\nA conundrum with all the excitement around using AI to detect fires is that the boom of new energy-hungry AI data centers has also led to a spate of new fossil fuel projects. Planet-heating pollution from new oil and gas infrastructure can literally add fuel to the fire by exacerbating climate change.\n\nEnergy demand is something Forrest says he considered, too, before implementing the new program. HPE’s smart city platform will run out of a nearby data center that is primarily powered by renewable energy. The data center is plugged into the local power grid with electricity provided by Holy Cross Energy, a rural electric co-op that says that 76 percent of its portfolio in 2024 was made of renewable energy (mostly wind). That’s a higher proportion than the nation as a whole; only about 20 percent of the US electricity mix comes from renewables.\n\nWildfire detection and prevention are only one piece of HPE’s smart city platform. Vail also plans to use it to streamline administrative tasks, including reviewing housing permits and business license applications, make sure municipal websites are in compliance with federal laws ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities, and more. A new “digital concierge” at the public library is supposed to help provide information to residents and visitors. The town of just 4,300 residents is inundated with up to 30,000 visitors a day during peak ski season, and the hope is that the AI platform can free up staff to tackle the most pressing priorities."

        "content": "This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nFueled by unusually warm waters, Hurricane Melissa this week turned into one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded. Now a new rapid attribution study suggests human-induced climate change made the deadly tropical cyclone four times more likely.\n\nHurricane Melissa collided with Jamaica on Tuesday, wreaking havoc across the island before tearing through nearby Haiti and Cuba. The storm, which reached Category 5, reserved for the hurricanes with the most powerful winds, has killed at least 40 people across the Caribbean so far. Now weakened to a Category 2, it continues its path toward Bermuda, where landfall is likely on Thursday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nEarly reports of the damage are cataclysmic, particularly in hardest-hit western Jamaica. Winds reaching speeds of 185 miles per hour and torrential rain flattened entire neighborhoods, decimated large swaths of agricultural lands and forced more than 25,000 people—locals and tourists alike—to seek cover in shelters or hotel ballrooms. According to the new attribution study from Imperial College London, climate change ramped up Melissa’s wind speeds by 7 percent, which increased damages by 12 percent.\n\nLosses could add up to tens of billions of dollars, experts say.\n\nThe findings echo similar reports released earlier this week on how global warming contributed to the likelihood and severity of Hurricane Melissa. Each of the analyses add to a growing body of research showing how ocean warming from climate change is fueling the conditions necessary for stronger tropical storms.\n\nHurricane Melissa is “kind of a textbook example of what we expect in terms of how hurricanes respond to a warming climate,” said Brian Soden, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami, who was not involved in the recent analyses. “We know that the warming ocean temperatures [are] being driven almost exclusively by increasing greenhouse gases.”\n\nThe storm has disrupted every aspect of life in this part of the Caribbean.\n\n“There’s been massive dislocation of services. We have people living in shelters across the country,” Dennis Zulu, United Nations resident coordinator in Jamaica, said in a press conference on Wednesday. “What we are seeing in preliminary assessments is a country that’s been devastated to levels never seen before.”\n\nThe Climate Connection\n\nFor the rapid attribution study, researchers at Imperial College used the peer-reviewed Imperial College Storm Model, known as IRIS, which has created a database of millions of synthetic tropical cyclone tracks that can help fill in gaps on how storms operate in the real world.\n\nThe model essentially runs simulations on the likelihood of a given storm’s wind speed—often the most damaging factor—in a pre-industrial climate versus the current climate. Applying IRIS to Hurricane Melissa is how the researchers determined that human-induced warming supercharged the cyclone’s wind speed by 7 percent."

        "content": "Jamaicans take stock after hurricane causes damage, flooding and power cuts\n\n6 days ago Share Save Nick Davis, Mandeville and Rachel Hagan Share Save\n\nEPA A woman surveys the damage to her home in northern Jamaica\n\nJamaicans are taking stock after Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to strike the island in modern history, barrelled across the country leaving behind a trail of ruin. Without power or phone coverage, much of the country is isolated and so information is trickling through. Authorities were only able to confirm the first deaths as a result of the hurricane over 24 hours after landfall. The bodies of three men and one woman were washed up by the flood waters in St Elizabeth Parish, local government minister Desmond McKenzie said. There, Prime Minister Andrew Holness said \"images of destruction are all around\". \"The damage is great, but we are going to devote all our energy to mount a strong recovery,\" he said. Three-quarters of the country are still without power, according to the latest media briefing. On the road west out of the capital Kingston we saw minimal damage - some structures torn down, trees strewn across roads and gardens. But once we arrived in central Jamaica we started to see how severely the island has been hit. The town of Mandeville has been, for want of a better word, flattened. A petrol station had lost its roof and most of its pumps. The main road that runs through the town is littered in debris, foliage is stuck to everything and bits of building material were scattered along the road. By early Wednesday the hurricane had made landfall in Cuba, causing flooding and damage. In Haiti more than 25 people were killed, most when a river burst its banks in Petit-Goave, the local mayor said. At its peak, the hurricane sustained winds of 298 km/h (185 mph) - stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 and killed 1,392 people. It has since weakened to a Category 3 hurricane.\n\nHurricane Melissa - what we know about the damage in Jamaica\n\nAs wind and rain lashed through the night, one local Jamaican official said the destruction resembled \"the scene of an apocalypse movie\". Many parts of Jamaica's western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds after the hurricane tore across the island with catastrophic force. People have shared clips of roads that became rivers, mudslides on the hills, roofs being ripped from buildings and palm trees tossed like tooth picks. In the town of Black River on the south-west coast, police officer Warrell Nicholson was sheltering in the damaged police station along with some residents. \"It's been devastating,\" he told the AFP news agency. Further up the coast, Andrew Houston Moncure was sheltering in the luxury hotel he owns, with his wife and 20-month-old son. At the height of the hurricane they barricaded themselves inside the shower, which they fortified with pillows and blankets. \"It was the most terrifying experience, especially with my son. The pressure is so low you struggle to breathe, and it just sounds like a freight train going over you,\" he told AFP. Across Jamaica's central parishes, flood waters rose to the roofs of two-storey homes, Kingston-based journalist Kimone Francis of The Jamaica Gleaner said. Verna Genus, a 73-year-old vegetable farmer, was sheltering from the storm with her sons and baby grandchild at her four-bedroom home in the village of Carlisle, St Elizabeth, when the hurricane ripped the zinc roof off her house. \"She was crying on the phone,\" her UK-based sister June said, adding: \"You are huddled up inside and then you look up then the roof is gone. I have never heard her like that - she was wailing 'we are all finished'.\" She is anxiously waiting for communications networks to be restored so she can talk to her sister. St Elizabeth, known as Jamaica's breadbasket, produces much of the island's produce. With crops submerged and fields destroyed, many farmers will struggle to financially recover. Jamaica's prime minister told the BBC in some instances \"there was total devastation\" and that one town named Black River had been \"totally destroyed\".\n\nOn the north coast, Montego Bay - the heart of Jamaica's tourism industry and home to its main airport - will also take time to get back on its feet. Montego city was split in two by flood waters, Mayor Richard Vernon said. He told BBC Breakfast: \"Once the wind subsided, we started to get a lot of heavy rain and that has led to massive floods right across the city. One side of the city is now cut off from the other due to roads being inundated by flood water.\" His immediate concern, he added, was simple: \"Check if everybody is alive.\" In rural Jamaica, the storm has left people shaken. Tamisha Lee, president of the Jamaica Network of Rural Women Producers, said: \"Right now, what I'm seeing is heavy rain, powerful wind, a lot of things flying all over the place, and trees uprooted. There is no electricity. I am feeling anxious and tense. The damage will be enormous.\" Meteorologists said Hurricane Melissa intensified at a speed rarely seen, its rapid strengthening fuelled by abnormally warm Caribbean waters - part of a broader trend linked to climate change. By the time it struck Jamaica, the storm had reached Category 5 strength, with gusts fierce enough to tear roofs from concrete homes, uproot trees and snap power poles. Health officials even issued a crocodile warning, cautioning that flood waters could drive the reptiles into residential areas. For thousands of tourists caught on the island, the storm brought terror and uncertainty."

The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. Rescuers located two bodies, and are still searching for the remaining five, who are believed to have been buried by snow. Eight others have been rescued and are in the capital Kathmandu getting treatment for their injuries. All these climbers were part of a group that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told BBC Nepali.\n\nThe bodies of the other five deceased climbers \"may be 10-15 feet below the snow\", said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks. \"It will take time to find them.\" Those killed include two Italians, a Canadian, a German, a French national, and two Nepalis who served as guides. Local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC on Monday that a rescue helicopter had landed in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp. One of the injured climbers told The Kathmandu Post that they had repeatedly called for help, to no avail. \"Had the rescue arrived on time, more lives could have been saved,\" he told the newspaper. Mr Mahato told reporters that rescue efforts were hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, which made it hard to fly helicopters or reach the site on foot. The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft). They had planned to climb the 5,630m Yalung Ri as part of their acclimatisation schedule."

        "content": "'No help, no food, no water': Hurricane-hit Jamaican towns desperately wait for aid\n\n2 days ago Share Save Brandon Drenon in Westmoreland, Jamaica Share Save\n\nWatch: Hurricane Melissa - aerial view of 'ground zero' destruction\n\nFive days after Hurricane Melissa pummelled into western Jamaica with record force, residents in devastated communities along the coast are still desperately waiting for help. Many of the roads are blocked by debris and people are isolated with little food, no power or running water, and no idea of when normalcy will return. The government said on Saturday that at least 28 people in Jamaica have died since the hurricane hit as a monster category five storm with 185 mph (297km/h) sustained winds. That is a near 50% jump in the death toll overnight, and the number could rise as officials clear their way into new parts of the island in the coming days. Local official Dr Dayton Campbell told the BBC 10 of those deaths were in Westmoreland. Westmoreland parish is believed to have the second highest number of unconfirmed deaths, after St Elizabeth to the south east. The eye of the storm hit somewhere between the two neighbouring parishes. At St Elizabeth an estimated 90% of homes have been destroyed.\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC News A town just outside of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish sits in ruins\n\nA long stretch of road headed west into Westmoreland Parish winds through a graveyard of trees – stacks of branches and limbs, cracked and twisted, blanketing the landscape for miles. It is grim evidence of Hurricane Melissa's ferocity - it was the strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history. Piles of debris are heaped on the parish's roadsides, next to battered buildings, shipping crates turned on their side and crowds of people wading through the destruction. On Saturday morning, men with machetes hacked through branches as thick as their arms, clearing patches of the road where traffic jams were at a standstill. A policeman with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest, part of a convoy accompanying an aid truck on its way to Westmoreland, hopped out of his vehicle to help direct traffic. \"We don't know what lies ahead,\" the officer told the BBC, describing what he has seen as \"total devastation\".\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Roy Perry says he has lost everything in the wake of the strongest hurricane in Jamaican history\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Anthony Burnett (left) and Gary Williams (right)\n\nThose living in Whitehouse, a coastal town and commercial hub on the edge of Westmoreland Parish, say the wait for assistance is becoming frustrating. Gary Williams said he has heard promises of incoming aid delivery, but \"they no turn up\". He sat in the shade on a makeshift stool in front of a building barely standing – its entire roof gone – unsure of what to do next. Williams said he lost his house in the storm and has \"nowhere to live\", suggesting he might sleep right where he is, outside on the front porch. Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Words can't explain the situation that we're in. It's horrible. I don't even know what to say. So many hopeless, helpless and lifeless people here right now.\"\n\nAbout 400,000 people in Jamaica were without power as of Friday, and an untold number more have no access to cell phone service or Wi-Fi, cut off from the outside world. Jamaica's transportation minister Daryl Vaz announced on Saturday that more than 200 StarLink devices have been deployed across the island to help people access the internet. He addressed criticism the government has received for its response, saying there were \"several factors\" contributing to delays. \"Refuelling, Areas for Landing, Accessibility and Timing/Visibility,\" Vaz said on X. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged that the \"immediate focus is on clearing debris, restoring essential services\", as well as providing food and medical supplies. But that would only solve part of the problem.\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Residents of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish try to piece their lives back together\n\nIn a tiny community just outside of Whitehouse, Robert Morris rested against a slab of broken concrete. Behind him, the fishing village he has called home his entire life has been destroyed, along with his livelihood. \"We all devastated here, man,\" he said. He said the boat house was destroyed and is now \"flat\". \"Melissa take everything down,\" he said, including his fishing boat, which he describes as \"mashed up\". Morris also told of \"no help, no food, no water\". \"We just have to try and see what we can do,\" he said, adding that his plan was to find someone whose boat was still intact so that he could join and fish. Even then, he is not sure where he would sell his catch. The people in these areas are filled with pride and resilience, words that are often repeated on local radio stations and visible through their optimism in the most difficult circumstances. Seated under the facade of a badly damaged building, Roy Perry said he has lost everything, but \"we have to just keep the faith and the hope is up still\".\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Robert Morris fishing village in view over his right shoulder has been entirely destroyed\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Oreth Jones, a local farmer, said his farm was \"all wrecked\""

A category five hurricane - those capable of catastrophic damage - has winds in excess of 157mph.\n\nAt least 31 people have been killed in Haiti as a result of Melissa, while at least two deaths have been reported in the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn Cuba, thousands of people have been evacuated as more than 60,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall."

If you were in Miami, you wouldn’t even know it was raining,” said National Weather Service meteorologist George Rizzuto. “These weather features co-located and led to the pretty heavy showers last night.”\n\nWhile the Boca Raton Airport temporarily closed “due to severe flooding,” it was reopened as of 7 a.m. on Oct. 27.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami said homes in Boca Raton near Southwest 18th Street and Southwest 8th Avenue had water completely covering their yards and “almost entering homes.” Cars were submerged up to the top of their wheel wells at Palmetto Park Road and State Road A1A.\n\n\"City crews and public safety teams are out this morning assessing storm impacts across the community,\" the city of Boca Raton posted on social media. \"Please use extra caution on the road, as there may be abandoned or stalled vehicles and areas of localized flooding.\"\n\nRecord rainfall throughout Palm Beach County\n\nSouth Florida Water Management District gauges measured 6.38 inches of rain in coastal Delray Beach. A gauge near South Military Trail in Boca Raton measured 6.74 inches.\n\nBoynton Beach received 4.62 inches, a gauge at the West Palm Beach and Lake Worth Beach border measured 5.83 inches and 3.12 inches was measured in North Palm Beach, with 3.21 inches falling in Jupiter.\n\nThe record 2.37 inches at Palm Beach International Airport beat the previous record of 1.62 inches for the same day in 2012.\n\nA report from the NWS shows that Deerfield Beach, near the border of Boca Raton, got 8.64 inches of rain. It lists Lantana has having received 6.6 inches of rain and an area of the town of Palm Beach got 6.06 inches.\n\nSouth Florida is just two weeks into the dry season. The wet season officially runs May 15 through Oct. 15 for the seven counties overseen by the Miami NWS office. Those include Palm Beach, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Broward, Collier, Glades and Hendry.\n\nPalm Beach County was considered in drought through much of the wet season, but was drought free as of Oct. 16, according to the U.S. Drought Monitory.\n\nPBIA measured 31 inches of rain during the wet season, which was down 6.14 inches from normal. Palm Beach Gardens measured 31.36 inches, which was a deficit of 9 inches. About 38.7 inches of rain fell in the Greenacres and Lake Worth Beach area, which was about normal, according to the weather service.\n\nCold weather forecast for Florida, Palm Beach County\n\nThe Oct. 26 and Oct. 27 rainfall precedes two cold fronts that are forecast to sweep down the Florida peninsula on Oct. 29 with the first weaker front reinforced by a more robust push of Canadian air that will drop temperatures into the low 60s in coastal Palm Beach County on Halloween morning.\n\nHigh temperatures on Oct. 30 are forecast to reach into the mid-70s. Those are forecast to barely clear 70 degrees on Oct. 31 with the official forecast for West Palm Beach reaching 73 degrees.\n\nThat means temperatures will be running near 10 degrees below normal. The average daytime high in West Palm Beach for Oct. 31 is 82 degrees with the normal overnight low dipping just to 69 degrees.\n\nThe last time it hit 65 degrees or below in West Palm Beach was on April 17.\n\n“By Thursday, we will really start feeling the impacts,” said Zach Law, a meteorologist with the NWS in Melbourne about the cold front. “It’s going to be very comfortable.”\n\nHow will the colder temperatures affect iguanas?\n\nThe cold temperatures won't do anything to cull the invasive green iguana herd that has proliferated in South Florida.\n\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officials said iguanas can become either immobilized or sluggish when temperatures hit between 40 and 50 degrees. Longer cold snaps with overcast skies that prevent basking for warmth can be deadly as the paralyzed iguanas become easy prey to vultures, bobcats and coyotes.\n\nAlso, when the lizards are immobilized by the cold, their digestive systems sour and they die from bacterial infections. Iguanas that fall from trees onto streets are also in danger of becoming road kill.\n\nThe last significant die-off of iguanas caused by cold weather occurred during the winter of 2010 when between Jan. 2 and Jan. 13, West Palm Beach's overnight lows dipped into the 30s nine times.\n\nThis week's fronts are part of the seasonal change that sees the jet stream taking deeper forays into the subtropics during the winter months.\n\nThis time, the journey south will also protect Florida from Hurricane Melissa, which deepened to a Category 5 hurricane with 160 mph winds as of early Oct. 27.\n\nIt's typically not until early November when overnight low temperatures in South Florida dip into the upper 60s. And the area must wait until the middle to latter part of November before daytime high temperatures peak in the upper 70s.\n\nMelissa is the third Category 5 hurricane this season following Erin and Humberto. Only one other Atlantic hurricane season has had more than two Category 5 storms. That was 2005 with Emily, Katrina, Rita and Wilma, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nJamaica is bracing for Melissa, which will likely be the most powerful hurricane on record to hit the island, and is forecast to bring up to 40 inches of rain in some areas.\n\nHurricane Gilbert in 1988 made landfall in Jamaica as a Category 4 storm with maximum wind speeds of 130 mph.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned of catastrophic and life-threatening landslides and flash flooding through Oct. 28 in Jamaica.\n\n“Destructive winds, especially in the mountains, will begin by this evening, leading to extensive infrastructural damage, long-lasting power and communication outages, and isolated communities,” NHC forecasters said in their 5 a.m. update on Oct. 27.\n\nHurricane season runs through Nov. 30.\n\nKimberly Miller is a journalist for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network of Florida.

        "content": "As Category 5 Hurricane Melissa bears down on Jamaica with winds topping 180 mph, social media is being hit by a surge of AI-generated and misleading videos, showing catastrophic flooding, collapsing buildings and rescue scenes that never happened.\n\nAcross X, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media platforms, fake clips spread quickly, racking up millions of views in hours. Many of these videos are spliced footage from past storms or clips created entirely with text-to-video AI tools.\n\nCNET\n\nIn times of crisis, like a dangerous and imminent natural disaster, these fake videos can create confusion, panic and distraction at a time when accuracy can be life-saving.\n\nNatural disasters have always bred rumors and recycled footage, but the rise of AI-generated video has supercharged the problem. Tools like OpenAI's Sora and other AI-video platforms can render realistic-looking images of storms, floods and damage scenes in seconds, reaching millions online in just a few hours.\n\nRead more: The Deepfakes Are Winning. How Can You Tell if a Video Is Real or Sora AI?\n\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.\n\nWhy storms are a magnet for fake news\n\nStorms are visual, emotional and fast-moving, which is the perfect recipe for viral misinformation. In years past, videos were often taken out of context or labeled as a different storm. Now, they can be digitally fabricated from scratch.\n\nSome depict apocalyptic flooding that hasn't occurred, while others claim to show \"real-time\" conditions hours before landfall. Several videos that have circled this week include images of sharks swimming in the storm surge and unsettling depictions of human suffering.\n\nFalse videos like these can exaggerate the danger of the storm, create panic, undermine trust and distract emergency responders, as misinformation pulls attention from verified reports.\n\nThe following three videos are all fake. They are labeled (albeit briefly) with the Sora watermark, which indicates they were made in OpenAI's video generator.\n\nHow to separate truth from fiction online\n\nWhen social feeds fill with dramatic hurricane clips, it's important to separate truth from fiction.\n\n\"You have to be very discerning,\" Sen. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's information minister, said. \"You have to know what is good information from bad information. If you want to know where the storm is going, if you want to know what to do, you need to look for official sources.\"\n\nDixon highlighted that the Jamaica Information Service, Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management's information sites and the Office of the Prime Minister page are resources for legitimate, timely updates.\n\nHere are some ways to be discerning.\n\nCheck the source. If the video comes from an unfamiliar account, lacks a timestamp or carries no recognizable media branding, assume it is fake until verified. Also, look for the Sora watermark indicating it was made in OpenAI's app, or read the comments to see if someone else has flagged the video as fake.\n\nAsk yourself if it's new and local. Does the geography match Jamaica? Is the footage recent? Many \"Melissa\" clips could actually be from past Caribbean or Gulf storms.\n\nCross-check before believing. Confirm through trusted outlets, like the Meteorological Service of Jamaica and the US National Hurricane Center, or established media like the BBC, Reuters or the Associated Press.\n\nPause before sharing. A viral video can cause harm if it spreads misinformation. Wait until a credible source verifies it before reposting.\n\nGo local. If you're in the affected area, rely on local emergency agencies, radio stations and city or county-level officials for evacuation and safety updates.\n\nMonitor official alerts. For real-time instructions, stick with government channels and local emergency feeds. Your safety depends on accurate information, not viral content.\n\nAs AI-generated media becomes easier to produce, hurricanes like Melissa offer a preview of a new reality: one in which you can't trust much of the information you see online.\n\nStaying safe means being skeptical and diligent when looking for accurate and even lifesaving news.\n\nRead more: What Is AI Slop?

They are among the UK nationals on the island bracing themselves for what could be the most powerful storm ever to hit Jamaica. The couple are due to fly back to the UK on Wednesday but the possibility of severe flooding as a result of the storm has left this uncertain.\n\nHurricane Melissa is forecast to bring \"catastrophic and life-threatening conditions, and made landfall with with winds of up to 185mph (297km/h).

He added: \"Yesterday evening, we had to leave our rooms and go to a safer building nearby.\" The couple are not the only Britons in Jamaica celebrating a significant milestone. Rebecca Chapman is in Jamaica for her 25th wedding anniversary and told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she and her family have also been told not to leave their hotel room. \"There's this weird roar that sounds like it's coming from the sea. It's really odd, like something's coming. The birds have all gone so it's all gone really quiet. It's like a ghost town,\" she said.\n\nMegan Berry Megan Berry is in Jamaica says she has a bag packed ready in case she is evacuated\n\nMegan Berry, a primary school teacher from west London, is currently in Montego Bay. She flew to Jamaica on Saturday for a friend's birthday. She told the BBC that the hotel she is in went into lockdown on Monday night and they have been advised to put mattresses against the windows. They have also packed their bags in case they need to be evacuated. Another British family say they have prepared a \"shelter\" in the bathroom of their hotel room - with food, drink, spare clothing, bedding in there. Brian Johnson, who is on holiday with his wife and wider family, said their focus is getting through unscathed. \"If we need help at any time during the main storm it is unlikely to be available, so we are essentially on our own.\" He said they are extremely thankful to their local Jamaican hosts and staff, many of whom are staying at the hotel to support guests despite having families and properties to take care of.\n\n'Staff amazing'\n\nAndrew Brearley and his wife Julia from Manchester came to Montego Bay for their 25th wedding anniversary. Their hotel is just 182m (600ft) away from the beach. What would have been a scenic view is now a constant reminder of what's looming. As they sit in the bathroom of their hotel, he says \"I just want to come out the other side of this storm\". Despite such uncertain times, like Mr Johnson they say the sense of community around the hotel is strong. \"The staff have been amazing, they haven't show any despair, they're doing everything they can to make sure we're safe and they're safe. The workers were given the choice to go or stay in the hotel, and a lot of them stayed.\" Meanwhile, David Rowe and his family made the decision to leave their holiday in Montego Bay early and fly home to Hertfordshire on Monday because of the storm. \"We made the decision on Saturday morning that no matter what we have to get home for the safety of the children,\" he told the BBC. \"We can't believe that when we were leaving on Sunday there were flights landing full of holiday makers.\" \"It has been an emotional time,\" Mr Rowe said, adding that they \"feel for anyone\" still in Jamaica.\n\nDisaster response\n\nAs well as British holidaymakers, the BBC has spoken to Britons anxiously watching from afar as their loved ones prepare for impact. Among them is Jodi Jenny, who now lives in Northamptonshire but grew up in the Jamaican parish of St Mary and still has loved ones living there, including her grandfather. She says that while the country is used to storms, she cannot remember one as bad as this is forecast to be since Hurricane Gilbert, which killed more than 300 people when it hit Jamaica in the 1980s. \"This is a bad one,\" Ms Jenny told BBC Radio Northampton. \"It's just tough.

The National Hurricane Center expects it to make landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday morning as the strongest hurricane on record to strike the island.\n\nThe center of the hurricane is located about 130 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica and the storm is moving westward at just 3 mph.\n\nSatellite view of Melissa after it became a Category 5 Monday morning. NASA\n\n“Do not venture out of your safe shelter,” the NHC said Monday morning. “Catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely today through Tuesday. Destructive winds, especially in the mountains, will begin by this evening, leading to extensive infrastructural damage, long-lasting power and communication outages, and isolated communities.”\n\nTropical storm conditions are already ongoing in Jamaica and hurricane conditions will arrive tonight into early Tuesday as Melissa pushes onshore.\n\nThe Jamaican government issued mandatory evacuation orders Sunday evening for several vulnerable coastal communities, including parts of Kingston, as Melissa intensifies on its approach to the Caribbean nation.\n\n“Storm surge is expected mainly over the southern side of the island, and this would be to the east of the center as it starts to, as it approaches the south coast, and as it begins to make impact,” Evan Thompson, the principal director of Jamaica’s Meteorological Service, said Sunday.\n\nA hurricane warning is effect for Jamaica, where hurricane conditions are expected by Monday night. Cuba has also issued a hurricane warning for the eastern provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin. A tropical storm warning has been issued for much of Haiti, and the government of the Bahamas has issued a hurricane watch for the central and southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nMelissa has been moving at a snail’s pace for days and it won’t pick up speed anytime soon as it tracks generally westward until Monday afternoon.\n\nThat slow movement has already caused problems. Torrential rain bands have swamped Haiti and the Dominican Republic the last several days, causing flooding and triggering landslides. At least three deaths have been reported in Haiti due to the storm, two of which were the result of a landslide, the Haitian Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. In the Dominican Republic, at least one person has died and more than 1,000 people have evacuated or been displaced, officials said Friday.\n\nMelissa doubled in strength over the weekend as it underwent extreme rapid intensification over exceptionally warm water in the Caribbean.\n\nThis explosive strengthening is happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.\n\nMelissa’s extreme threats\n\nJamaica, Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic will face the worst of the storm through Tuesday. Next in line for strong winds, storm surge and flooding rain will be eastern Cuba, the southern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.\n\nRainfall totals up to 30 inches are expected from Melissa in parts of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through Wednesday, with local maxima of 40 inches. Eastern Cuba could receive totals of up to 20 inches.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nJamaica will not only endure Melissa’s torrential rain, but will also have to contend with days of ferocious winds. The most extreme winds will likely occur as Melissa tracks over Jamaica on Monday night into Tuesday. Downed trees, power outages and structural damage could be widespread.\n\nWinds on windward sides of hills and mountains could be 30% higher than what lower elevations experience, the hurricane center warned.\n\nOfficials in the country are already preparing for the worst. All public hospitals have been in “emergency mode” since Thursday evening, halting outpatient and elective procedures to ensure more beds are open, according to Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness.\n\nEmergency shelters have been “activated” across the country for people living in vulnerable areas, Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie said Sunday in a press conference.\n\nJamaica’s airports are closing. Norman Manley International Airport closed after its last scheduled arriving flight at 8 p.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) Saturday evening, according to Daryl Vaz, the minister of transport.\n\nThe Sangster International Airport also closed on Sunday, Vaz said.\n\n“There is nowhere that will escape the wrath of this hurricane,” Thompson, from Jamaica’s Meteorological Service, said Saturday. “It’s going to sit there, pouring water while it’s barely moving and that is a significant challenge… as long as what is predicted does take place.”\n\nPeak storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. Storm surge will also be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\n“Now is the time to secure your home, check your roof, windows, and surroundings. Use sandbags or plywood where needed and clear any overhanging branches safely,” Holness, the prime minister, wrote on X. “If you live in a flood-prone area, take protective measures and have an evacuation plan ready”\n\nJamaicans who spoke with Reuters on Saturday acknowledged the danger of a slow-moving hurricane, contrasting Melissa’s sluggish pace to Hurricane Beryl.\n\n“Slow movement still cause a lot of damage, right?” said fisherman Clive Davis in Kingston. “Different from Beryl cause Beryls come with a speed and never stay too long. Just sweep through. But this now, she wants to come stay, visit Jamaica for 3 days, why?”\n\n“It’s gonna slow down business, but it’s nature,” Davis added. “We can’t fight against nature, right?”\n\nInto Saturday, workers in Kingston dredged as much trash and silt as they could from the bottom of Sandy Gully, an approximately 20 km long waterway snaking along the city’s western flank. When Melissa brings its months’ worth of rain as it passes over Jamaica, the swollen, debris-filled gully could knock out bridges, splitting Kingston in two.\n\nThe United States mainland is not expected to be directly threatened by Melissa. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.\n\nHurricane Beryl in July 2024 was the last storm to heavily impact Jamaica. It did not make landfall, but still lashed the island with flooding rain and strong winds as it passed to the south as a Category 4."

        "content": "Seismometers picked up the ferocious winds and waves of Hurricane Melissa, showing how the tools can be used to better understand storms today and those from the past\n\nHurricane Melissa will go down as one of the worst hurricanes ever in the Atlantic Ocean, with the hurricane reaching a strength that only a handful of storms have achieved in recorded history. Melissa was so powerful—with astounding 185-mile-per-hour peak winds—that it literally made the ground tremble hundreds of miles away in Florida, where its march across the ocean was picked up on seismometers, instruments designed to detect earthquakes.\n\nThough plenty of intense storms have shown up on these sensors before, the recordings underscore the destructive force of the Melissa, a Category 5 hurricane that devastated parts of Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. They also highlight how a tool that is typically used for geological purposes can improve our understanding of one Earth’s most ferocious weather phenomena—in particular, by opening a window into the hurricanes that raged before satellites and plane reconnaissance was possible.\n\nDespite seismic waves being readily associated with fault movements and their tremors, “seismometers aren’t just used for earthquakes,” says seismologist and earthquake geologist Wendy Bohon, whose organizational affiliation can’t currently be given because of the ongoing shutdown of the federal government. “Seismometers detect anything that puts energy into the ground. That could be Taylor Swift concerts; that could be construction; that could be people walking around seismometers.” Landslides, avalanches, asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions and clandestine nuclear weapons explosions all appear as curious squiggles in the tools’ output because they all generate seismic waves.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nHurricanes and typhoons are no exception, and they wobble Earth’s crust in two different ways. The first is “due to the wind vibrating trees, telegraph poles, fenceposts, etcetera, which then couples into the ground as a seismic wave,” says Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at University College London.\n\nThe second, more major component comes from the storms jostling the ocean itself. “As waves go up and down, they drum on the ocean floor,” Bohon says. Sometimes this percussive action is represented on seismometers by subtle peaks and troughs. Hurricane Melissa ominously registered on Jamaica’s seismometers as eerily obvious serrated teeth in the days leading up to landfall. “It makes your heart drop a little bit because you recognize the ferocity of the storm,” Bohon says.\n\nHurricanes and typhoons are tracked and studied relatively easily in real time: barometers and daring “Hurricane Hunter” pilots record changes in air pressure, oceanic sensors monitor changing temperatures, and satellites can build three-dimensional pictures of these maelstroms. Seismometers, which run continuously and can be found all over the world, can also be used to track the trajectory of the hurricane, says Andreas Fichtner, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.\n\nDownload the video EarthScope Consortium\n\nAlthough helpful in the here and now, this is particularly useful for understanding hurricanes in the somewhat more antiquated past—back when aerial surveys and satellite sleuthing weren’t options. “In the presatellite era, we already had a seismic network on the surface of the Earth,” Fichtner says. It’s not anywhere near as dense as it is today, but it’s still sufficient for hurricane researchers hoping to rewind time so they can find out where tropical cyclones used to be born and where the storms previously dissolved away.\n\nThis multidecadal seismic soundtrack also shows potential in determining the intensities of past hurricanes. Storm-generated seismic waves are effectively recording changes in ocean wave height. That means scientists could calibrate the cacophony of today’s hurricanes with their intensity and then use what’s preserved in old seismic catalogs to see if cyclones have become stronger over time.\n\nAs sea-surface temperatures have risen dramatically with global warming, climate models have predicted that, over the coming years, hurricanes will get stronger, bringing higher wind speeds, greater rainfall and more vigorous storm surges to bear on anyone in their paths. There are some indications that this effect is already in play. And if, as recent research suggests, seismometers can determine the strength of tropical storms that existed long ago, our understanding of this trend will undoubtedly improve.\n\nThe fact that seismometers can be used in an unconventional way to study our rapidly changing world is fascinating, Bohon says. But seeing increasingly savage storms such as Melissa appear on these sensors is also “frightening and heartbreaking,” she adds."

Locals and tourists told the BBC how they hunkered down as the storm ripped roofs off buildings and cut power to about a third of the country's 2.8 million people. \"The doors are being blown off by the wind,\" said Kabien, a mother-of-three who runs a beauty salon in the town of Santa Cruz. With panic in her voice, she said: \"I am trying to use my own manpower to stop the wind blowing in the door.\"\n\nWatch: Strong winds and flying debris as Hurricane Melissa makes landfall\n\n\"There is water coming through the roof of the house,\" she said. \"I am not OK.\" Her three young children were \"very, very scared\", she added. Melissa made landfall on Tuesday afternoon in south-western Jamaica near the town of New Hope with wind speeds of 185 mph (295 km/h), according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC). Originally a category five storm, it was downgraded to category three after it made landfall and swept across the island. Officials said it would continue to decrease in intensity, but remain extremely dangerous as it moves towards Cuba and then the Bahamas. Kyle Holmes, from Bolton, who is visiting Jamaica with his wife and young daughters, aged 7, 10, and 12, for a family wedding, told the BBC of the devastation wreaked by the storm. He said the hotel he was staying in - the Grand Palladium Resort, in the town of Lucea, half an hour from Montego Bay on the coast - looks like \"a disaster zone\". He said he barricaded the windows to the hotel room by placing all the furniture against them, and his family were safe after the \"worst experience ever\".\n\nGetty Images A man installs storm shutters in Portmore; preparations for Hurricane Melissa have been ongoing for days across Jamaica\n\nWinston Warren, who has been riding out the hurricane from inside his home in east Kingston, less than a kilometre from the ocean, told the BBC: \"There are times you just wonder - are the waves going to come crashing into your house. \"We've seen a lot of roofs blown off.\" Emma, who is on a family holiday in Jamaica from Essex, England, said the windows of their Montego Bay hotel had been smashed by high winds. \"We moved to a safe room as the children were petrified,\" she said. \"The windows have been blown through and the staff are working furiously to make us safe. \"We have all just moved to another room in the building as the glass in the lobby is unsafe. We are all terrified.\" Damion, a computer scientist living in Kingston, told the BBC he had woken on Tuesday to winds \"so strong you would not be able to stand up\" outside. Simon Johnson, 33, who lives in Harbour View in Kingston with his wife and two sisters, said the family had experienced hurricanes before - \"but not one of this size\". Living just 200m (650ft) from the harbour, he told the BBC he was \"feeling anxious\". They have stockpiled a week's worth of food, he added, but many of the supermarkets were empty and he could not find any bread in the neighbourhood.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'The birds have all gone'"

        "content": "Afghan earthquake triggers contradictory Taliban tactics on rescuing women\n\ntoggle caption Wakil Kohsar/AFP/via Getty Images\n\nAs earthquakes devastated parts of Afghanistan in late August , Taliban officials asked aid agencies to send more female health workers to assist female survivors. They also briefly barred female U.N. staffers from reaching earthquake-devastated areas.\n\nThe flurry of contradictions in the wake of the earthquake did not end there.\n\nAmid the aftermath, as aid groups and Taliban bureaucrats were assisting those injured and left homeless by the earthquake, other Taliban officials twice suspended most internet and cellular reception throughout Afghanistan, complicating aid efforts.\n\nThe incidents highlight the contortions of the Taliban four years after seizing power of Afghanistan.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHardliners are firmly in control, but more pragmatic factions appear to be constantly trying to find workarounds to govern — like urging female aid workers to head to earthquake-struck zones.\n\n\"It's an ongoing struggle,\" said a senior analyst, who requested anonymity because the Taliban has cracked down on people perceived as critical of them.\n\n(That individual, like more than a dozen people that NPR spoke to for this story, including senior representatives of international charities, local residents and respected analysts, asked that NPR not use their names. Others requested we only use their first names. Some of the people were worried their organizations would be punished if they were even perceived as being critical of the Taliban or were concerned about denials of visas for foreign staff or losing the right to continue operations.)\n\nThat to-and-fro could be seen in the Taliban's response to the deadly earthquake, which was most devastating in the isolated mountains of the eastern Kunar province in late August. Mud-and-stone homes clinging to steep mountainsides collapsed upon their sleeping inhabitants. From the vantage point of a helicopter, it looked like entire villages \"had just been scraped off the sides of hills,\" said Richard Trenchard, acting humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe U.N. estimates some 2,200 people were killed and more than 3,600 people were injured. The majority were women and girls — partly because there are more females than males in any given population, because the area is known for men migrating to find work and because women and girls were more likely to sleep inside structures that collapsed.\n\nWhere were the women?\n\nIn the first days after the earthquake struck, the Taliban shared a stream of videos of their defense forces choppering out the wounded from isolated villages. The wounded in these reels were all men, as if the Taliban had landed in villages with no female inhabitants.\n\nA local aid worker, who goes by one name, Wahidullah, told NPR that women were airlifted out, but in compliance with the Taliban's rules and cultural norms, they were not filmed and were segregated inside the helicopter. One video, filmed by a local aid group, accidentally showed women being rescued : They were huddled in the back of one chopper, most clad in burkhas.\n\nAnd two senior aid workers said Taliban officials encouraged them to send more female workers to help women and girls impacted by the earthquake because of Afghanistan's deeply conservative culture that limits male contact with females, and the Taliban's own rules that demand strict gender segregation. \"They were encouraging and requesting us to provide more, particularly in the case of medical support to women,\" said Trenchard. Another senior aid worker told NPR, \"The Taliban were asking for women doctors, they were asking for female medical teams, all female medical teams. We didn't have the resources available to give.\"\n\nThe Taliban's request for more women workers came despite the ratcheting restrictions that the group has been imposing since they seized power four years ago. That includes preventing most women and girls from study and work.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWho is behind the restrictions?\n\nBased on NPR's reporting since the Taliban seized power, those restrictions appear to have been ordered by the group's spiritual leader. Hibatullah Akhundzada lives in near-total secrecy in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar and rarely makes public appearances. Analysts point to how the restrictions have held, despite high-level pushback by other prominent clerics , and multiple attempts on the ground to sidestep the rules.\n\nThat pushback included the former deputy foreign minister Sher Abbas Stanikzai, who left Afghanistan in February after publicly criticizing the ban on girls studying beyond grade six multiple times . The Taliban's first higher education minister turned a blind eye to women attending university — even after a decision to let girls attend high school was dramatically rescinded in March 2022 — after girls had been told they could attend, and had to be pushed out of classrooms. (By December 2022, the Taliban had stopped most women from attending university.)\n\nAfter Afghan women were evicted from universities, the ministry of public health appeared to push back, creating a years-long nursing and midwifery course for Afghan women so they could help other women. \"It made hardliners uncomfortable,\" said the analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, who saw it as \"a workaround to our ban.\" The nursing and midwifery course was junked in December last year , only months after it began, apparently on the orders of the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada. The move highlighted how \"the most ultraconservative bit of the movement is in control and is increasing control,\" said Kate Clark , co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, a prominent research group.\n\nThat increasing control has come to the detriment of women and girls. They are mostly banned from being attended to by male doctors and medics. That's left women's health care in the hands of a diminishing number of women.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt the time, a prominent researcher on Afghanistan, Heather Barr of Human Rights Watch, put it this way: \"If you ban women from being treated by male health care professionals, and then you ban women from training to become health care professionals, the consequences are clear: Women will not have access to health care and will die as a result.\"\n\nThere is no country-wide data for Afghanistan, but it appears that not only are no new women coming through the Afghan health care system, there are fewer qualified women still working. Some appear to be leaving Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Analysts Network, also reported others were leaving amid plummeting salaries and deteriorating conditions. The network also reported female health workers saying that their newer colleagues were likely to be unskilled women who came from Taliban-loyal families.\n\nWhy aid workers faced obstacles\n\nThe lack of qualified female workers became one of the many obstacles that aid workers grappled with as they sought to reach the dead and wounded hours after the earthquake devastated parts of Afghanistan on September 1.\n\nAnother obstacle hindering the rescue of women was that the Taliban prevented female U.N. workers from reaching devastated areas. In a September 11, statement, the U.N. also said Afghanistan's Taliban rulers had prevented female U.N. staffers and contractors from entering their workplaces in the capital Kabul, the western city of Herat and the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.\n\nTrenchard, the acting U.N. humanitarian coordinator, said Taliban authorities did ultimately allow women working for the U.N. to assist earthquake victims in the field after negotiations, but they have not been allowed to return to their offices. Taliban authorities did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAll this meant that few female aid workers were available to treat women and girls injured by the earthquakes. Even to reach them, aid workers walked for hours on perilous roads on steep mountainsides. One female rescuer told the U.N.'s news service how they were \"dodging falling rocks every time there was an aftershock.\" The female health workers were expected to walk in headscarves and long loose robes. They also needed a mahram, a male guardian — a man related by blood whom a woman cannot marry, like a brother or nephew, or her own husband. That mahram has to be licensed by the Taliban.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAid workers said it was hard to entice their female staff to head to devastated areas, partly because their mahrams did not want to go, and partly because the conditions were so daunting. As a result, there were initially few women available to help other women, said Gharshin, a 50-year-old health worker who goes by only one name. She said female aid workers in the field did they best they could, including one midwife who trekked six hours to help a woman give birth.\n\nIn some cases, it appears that women who were injured in the earthquake were left unattended, until female health workers arrived. Aid workers said it wasn't just the Taliban's prohibitions on men treating women. Local communities also did not allow men, whether rescuers or medics, to help their female relatives. \"They were very strict and did not allow us to even see the wounded,\" said Omid Haqjo, a volunteer who hiked nine hours to lend a hand in an area known as the Mazar Dara Valley. He said it was a devastating sight, because \"most of the injured were children and women.\"\n\nSome women and girls had not received any health care, even two weeks after the earthquake, said aid worker, Fereshteh, who had been assigned to help females shifted to tents after their homes were destroyed.\n\nGharshin, the 50-year-old health worker, said what frustrated her was that the conservative Afghan traditions — alongside the Taliban's rules — meant that women could not be attended to except by other women. \"Imagine,\" she said, during the last earthquake, \"that women's clothes came off, or maybe their clothes were torn. They may be in a situation where it is difficult for a male rescuer to dare to pick her up. So it is natural that there should be a woman doing the rescuing.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhy did the internet go down?\n\nBut if there was any hope that Taliban authorities might relax their prohibitions on women studying, if only to help other women, it was dashed just two weeks after the earthquake struck.\n\nOn September 15, Taliban authorities rolled out a suspension of operations of the fiber optic cable that provides affordable and fast internet to most Afghans. The move was to \"prevent evil,\" according to Haji Zaid, spokesperson for the northern city of Balkh. But one of the casualties was the thousands of women and girls, who were studying online after being denied physical access to school.\n\nAccess was resumed in most places, until it was shut down again for 48 hours on September 29, alongside mobile cellular reception.\n\nDuring the first internet suspension, one father described to NPR how his daughters were quiet, pale and withdrawn after the internet was cut off. They were studying through an online university. He requested anonymity for the safety of his daughters. \"It's the same frustration,\" he said of four years under the Taliban, \"and the same darkness.\"\n\nAkbari reported from Paris. With additional reporting by Ruchi Kumar in Istanbul."

The roof of the house Davis and his parents shared in the small Jamaican fishing community of White House in Westmoreland parish was also destroyed.\n\nDavis was in Nicaragua, where he'd flown shortly before the storm to find new customers for his fish business. But now his livelihood, and the livelihoods of many in his community, were in peril.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“It’s going to be very rough” said Davis. “With the damage now, no one will be buying products.”\n\nAbout 29 kilometers (17 miles) northwest in Amity, also in Westmoreland parish, Denver Thorpe lost 15 acres (6 hectares) of mango trees and two greenhouses on his farm.\n\n“There’s absolutely nothing,” said Thorpe, a farmer and regional manager for the Jamaica Agricultural Society, a farmer advocacy organization.\n\nHurricane Melissa is blamed for at least 28 deaths in Jamaica, bringing catastrophic winds up to 185 mph (298 kph) and storm surge that wrecked homes and public infrastructure.\n\nWhile official damage assessments are still underway, experts said it's already clear that one of the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded also dealt a devastating blow to tens of thousands of Jamaican fishers and farmers who feed their families and nearby communities.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSimilar impacts will be felt by some of Cuba and Haiti ’s small producers, said Lola Castro, World Food Program regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n“I would say every (crop) that was on the path has been damaged, there’s no discussion on that,” said Castro. “Some of the fruit trees may be recovered, some of the temporary crops will not be recovered at all.”\n\nThe destruction will impact how residents earn income and feed their families at a time when they must also rebuild homes and communities. There were already 10 million food-insecure people across the affected countries of Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, said Castro. The WFP does not have that data for Cuba.\n\nIn Jamaica, the destruction comes just 15 months after Hurricane Beryl impacted more than 50,000 farmers and 11,000 fishers, and caused $4.73 billion Jamaican dollars (about $29 million) in losses, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“We were just about turning the corner,” said Thorpe.\n\n‘The lifeblood of the most vulnerable’\n\nJamaica’s agriculture ministry did not respond to questions about sector impacts, but the country has more than 200,000 farmers tending livestock and growing bananas, melons, cocoa and much more.\n\nThe food produced is for domestic consumption and export — Jamaica is one of the world's largest yam exporters and its coffee growers generate $25 million annually, according to the Jamaica Coffee Exporters Association.\n\nAround 80% are small-scale producers, working on 2 hectares of land or less, said Donovan Campbell, geography professor and director of the University of the West Indies’ western campus.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Small-scale fishing and small-scale farming is what most people use to make a living,” he said. “It is really the lifeblood of the most vulnerable in our society.”\n\nFarmers use October rains to plant crops to harvest before Christmas. Before the storm, the agriculture ministry urged fishers to move equipment out of harm's way and farmers to move livestock and harvest any crops they could.\n\nThe devastation exceeded most expectations. Officials Wednesday said St. Elizabeth parish, known as Jamaica's “breadbasket,\" was “ under water.\" The parish had over 35,000 registered farmers and fishers as of 2022, according to the Jamaica Information Service.\n\nFor fishers, Davis said it's not just losing boats, nets and traps that endangers their work. Without electricity, there’s no ice to store what they catch, and customers won’t buy what they can’t keep cold. Lack of tourism will hurt demand, too.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe slowdown is worse for fishers who use most of their catch to feed their families and sell a little extra, he said. “That small income every day maintains their house and their family and their school and children.\"\n\nThere are also special risks for women producers, said Davis and Campbell, many of whom are heads of household who support their children with the small amounts they sell.\n\nCompounding crises in Cuba and Haiti\n\nCuba and Haiti face similar challenges, exacerbated by their political and economic crises.\n\nThe storm unleashed terrible flooding in southern Haiti and is blamed for 31 deaths in the country, where hunger was already rising.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCastro of the World Food Program said the organization is concerned about the impact to some of Haiti's female producers, from whom the WFP typically buys produce to supply local schools.\n\n“We may need to bring food from other parts of the country if available or even having to import,” said Castro.\n\nIn Cuba, the evacuation of 735,000 people meant the country suffered no known deaths, but Melissa’s passage could worsen challenges in feeding Cubans. The country faces a severe economic crisis and spends some $2 billion annually importing food products.\n\nLocal officials said there was damage to plantain, corn and cassava crops, coffee, various vegetables and trees across the five affected eastern provinces.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGovernment officials said Melissa’s heavy rainfall did benefit dams and reservoirs, after the eastern part of the country had been suffering from a severe drought and water shortage.\n\n“That is one of the silver linings,” said Margarita Fernandez, executive director of the Caribbean Agroecology Institute in Vermont. CAI is raising funds to send directly to farmers and cooperatives there. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization also delivered seed to Cuba ahead of the storm, a spokesperson said.\n\nHelp arrives in phases\n\nRelief efforts across the northern Caribbean are focused on immediate needs for now, as first responders and humanitarian organizations provide shelter, health care, food and clean water, and restore power and communications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFood producers will soon need cash to make up for lost income, help replacing equipment and animals as well as new seed.\n\nThe Jamaican government keeps reserve funds, parametric insurance policies and catastrophe bonds for disasters. The government and nonprofits helped farmers and fishers after Hurricane Beryl replace what they lost.\n\nBut it can take a long time for that help to reach small scale producers, said Campbell.\n\nWith airports open again, Davis is looking for a flight to get back to White House. He needs to fix his boat, and his roof, but he doesn't know when he will sell fish again.\n\n“My worry is about when will the economy will be back to normal, where life goes on as it was before,” said Davis. “Everyone is picking up the pieces.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Andrea Rodríguez contributed reporting from Havana."

The report found that India recorded an average of 19.8 heatwave days last year, of which 6.6 days would not have occurred without human-induced climate change. It also estimated that heat exposure in 2024 resulted in the loss of 247 billion potential labour hours, mostly in the agriculture and construction sectors. amounting to an economic loss of about $194bn (£151bn). While heatwaves are not new to India, their frequency and intensity have been rising steadily over the past few decades because of global warming.\n\nProlonged exposure to extreme heat has serious repercussions on health. It can overwhelm the body's ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of dehydration, heatstroke, cardiovascular stress, and even death - particularly among the elderly, infants and outdoor workers. And the 2025 Lancet Countdown report - which tracks the health impact of climate change and is widely regarded as a key scientific reference on the issue - warns that the health risks posed by rising global temperatures are now more severe than ever. \"Throughout last year,152 record-breaking extreme weather events were registered across 61 countries, and life-threatening, extreme heat events are becoming more intense than previously predicted,\" the report stated. \"The climate crisis is a health crisis. Every fraction of a degree of warming costs lives and livelihoods,\" said Jeremy Farrar, assistant director-general for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care at the World Health Organization (WHO). The report found that heat-related mortality has increased by 23% worldwide since the 1990s, with an average of around 546,000 deaths each year.\n\nReuters India is among the most polluted countries in the world\n\nIt also found that the average person worldwide was exposed to 16 days of extreme heat last year that would not have occurred without climate change. \"This [report] paints a bleak and undeniable picture of the devastating health harms reaching all corners of the world,\" said Dr Marina Romanello, of University College London, who led the report's analysis. \"The destruction to lives and livelihoods will continue to escalate until we end our fossil fuel addiction,\" she added.\n\nAir Quality"

        "content": "Weather experts are tracking when the next hurricane could impact the United States in October as the 2025 hurricane season does not end until the end of November. As Lorenzo develops as a tropical depression in the Atlantic, a new tropical wave is forming off the cost of Africa that multiple weather models project could become a hurricane that will head through the Caribbean before moving north toward the southeastern coastline of America. Here’s the hurricane forecast for mid- to late-October.\n\nWill a hurricane be hitting the US this week in mid-October?\n\nFortunately, weather models do not expect a hurricane to be hitting the US by the end of the week, but a tropical wave could become a named storm in the Caribbean by some time late next week from October 21 to 25. If the storm does become strong enough to become a tropical depression, it will be named Melissa.\n\nAs noted by meteorologist Brian Shields (otherwise known as Mr. Weatherman on YouTube) on October 15, 2025, two weather models have this system off the coast of Africa becoming a hurricane. The more aggressive American GFS model has it forming into a hurricane by late next week and developing within the Caribbean Sea before potentially moving north toward the States. Moreover, the European model has it also developing into a hurricane by late next week but already coming close to the Florida coastline near the Cayman Islands and The Bahamas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Canadian GEM model projects that the wave will become a tropical storm by early next week and impacting Puerto Rico, Barbados, and Antigua & Barbuda. This is more or less in agreement with the German ICON model that has it become a tropical storm to the south of Jamaica by mid next week.\n\nThat said, there’s still about a week before meteorologists will know more about where this tropical wave is heading and how strong it will be. While the storm will likely draw strength from the high ocean temperatures in the Caribbean, wind shear could lessen the intensity of the storm."

The most populous part of the country, the capital Kingston, missed the brunt of the storm. The government says the international airport could reopen for relief flights as early as tomorrow. Meanwhile, the storm is battering the west coast of Cuba.\n\ntoggle caption Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\n🎧 More than half a million people are without power, and every region of Jamaica is facing blocked roads and downed power lines, according to the country's government. NPR's Eyder Peralta tells Up First that the biggest concern for the country currently is Western Jamaica, which was severely impacted when the storm made landfall with winds reaching 185 miles per hour and generated a storm surge of up to 13 feet. Desmond McKenzie, the minister of local government, said St. Elizabeth Parish is underwater and numerous families are trapped in their homes. McKenzie says rescue teams are hoping that they can get to those families today, and people are still alive.\n\nand downed power lines, according to the country's government.

The military says it was dismantling a Hamas tunnel in an area of Gaza where Israeli troops were stationed when militants opened fire, killing a soldier. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered immediate \"forceful strikes\" in Gaza. Gaza Civil Defense reports that the strikes killed about 100 Palestinians, including around 35 children. Israel says it killed 30 militants in the strikes.\n\n\n\n🎧 The strikes were one of the single deadliest 24-hour periods in Gaza, even deadlier than some of the days of war, according to NPR's Daniel Estrin. The ceasefire was back on as of 10 a.m. local time today in Israel. The dispute over the search for Israeli hostage bodies that remain in Gaza threatens to impact the fragile ceasefire. Israel has been considering limiting aid to Gaza to pressure Hamas to hand over the bodies more quickly.\n\nAir traffic controllers say working without pay this week due to the government shutdown is making a difficult job even harder. Maximilian Crawford, a controller at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, states that many controllers are living paycheck to paycheck and are now seeking financial assistance from loans or family members. The shutdown has disrupted flights across the U.S., and there is currently no end in sight.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n🎧 The controllers' union says many workers have turned to gig work, like driving for Uber or DoorDash, to make money. Though these workers are in the minority, it is adding stress to controllers. There have been isolated delays seen at U.S. airports due to staffing shortages, but overall these delays are generally in line with what's normal outside of the shutdown, NPR's Joel Rose says. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said yesterday that while many air traffic controllers can make it without their first paycheck, nearly all of them cannot manage without two. Even before the shutdown there was a shortage of air traffic controllers, so it doesn't take a big increase in sick calls to impact the fragile system, Rose says.\n\nDeep dive\n\ntoggle caption Dobrila Vignjevic/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThe obesity rate among U.S. adults has declined to 37% this year, down from a high of 39.9% three years ago, according to a new survey by the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index. The data indicate that GLP-1 weight loss drugs are having an impact. The number of Americans using injectable obesity treatments has doubled over the past year and a half. GLP-1 agonists, as the new treatments are known, were first approved for obesity treatment in the U.S. in 2021. Here's what is known about how the drugs' usage is bringing down the U.S. obesity rate:\n\n\n\n💪 Since the drugs have been introduced to the market, obesity rates have declined significantly among people between ages 40 and 64. This correlates with a higher reliance on GLP-1 medications.\n\n💪 The drugs have been a game-changer for patients with obesity, but access to them has been limited and is likely to become a bigger issue. Many private insurers are halting coverage for GLP-1 medications next year, which will make them a costly option for weight maintenance.\n\n💪 Drugmakers are working on bringing potentially less-expensive pill options to the market, but it still might not be the fix needed to make it more accessible for many people.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRead more about what the survey discovered.\n\nLife advice\n\nKristen Uroda for NPR\n\nWhen someone you know has cancer, it can be challenging to figure out how to support them effectively. One of the best ways to be present for your loved one is by considering what you are good at and how you can help them in their time of need. Life Kit has compiled a list of roles that friends and family members can take on to help someone with cancer. Each role addresses a critical need that a cancer patient may have.\n\n\n\n❤️ If you are organized and detail-oriented, you could be a good doctor's appointment buddy. This role is also good for someone with a medical background. This person could have a prepared list of questions, take the lead during appointments.\n\n❤️ If you are comfortable with physical touch, don't mind sitting in silence or possibly have a good comedy routine, you could make a great procedure pal and patient advocate. You can go with your loved one to their scans, surgeries and radiation and chemotherapy appointments. This role focuses less on asking questions and more on providing emotional and physical support.\n\n❤️ If you are good at planning and willing to take initiative, you could be a great household helper and meal planner. Try offering to bring over dinner or coordinating with friends who can help with different activities. Instead of asking, offer to do a specific task like laundry.\n\nFor tips on how to support a loved one through cancer treatment, listen to this episode of NPR's Life Kit.

        "content": "Hurricane Melissa leaves trail of destruction across Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica\n\ntoggle caption Ramon Espinosa/AP\n\nSANTIAGO DE CUBA, Cuba — Hurricane Melissa left at least dozens dead and caused widespread destruction across Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica, where roofless homes, toppled utility poles and water-logged furniture dominated the landscape Wednesday.\n\nA landslide blocked the main roads of Santa Cruz in Jamaica's St. Elizabeth parish, where the streets were reduced to mud pits. Residents swept water from homes as they tried to salvage belongings. Wind ripped off part of the roof at a high school that serves as a public shelter.\n\n\"I never see anything like this before in all my years living here,\" resident Jennifer Small said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe extent of the damage from the deadly hurricane was unclear Wednesday as widespread power outages and dangerous conditions persisted in the region.\n\n\"It is too early for us to say definitively,\" said Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister.\n\nMelissa made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph (295 kph), one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, before weakening and moving on to Cuba, but even countries outside the direct path of the massive storm felt its devastating effects.\n\nAt least 25 people have died across Haiti and 18 are missing, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement Wednesday. Twenty of those reported dead and 10 of the missing are from a southern coastal town where flooding collapsed dozens of homes. At least eight are dead in Jamaica.\n\nIn Cuba, officials reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads and roofs blown off buildings Wednesday, with the heaviest destruction concentrated in the southwest and northwest. Authorities said about 735,000 people remained in shelters.\n\n\"That was hell. All night long, it was terrible,\" said Reinaldo Charon in Santiago de Cuba. The 52-year-old was one of the few people venturing out Wednesday, covered by a plastic sheet in the intermittent rain.\n\nForecasters expect Melissa, now a Category 1 hurricane, to bring dangerous winds, flooding and storm surge to the Bahamas on Wednesday night.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nJamaica rushes to assess the damage\n\nIn Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dixon said 77% of the island was without power.\n\nThe outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.\n\n\"Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement. \"Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly.\"\n\nOfficials in Black River, Jamaica, a southwestern coastal town of approximately 5,000 people, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing,\" Mayor Richard Solomon said.\n\nSolomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm. The hospital, police units and emergency services were inundated by floods and unable to conduct emergency operations.\n\nJamaican Transportation Minister Daryl Vaz said two of the island's airports will reopen Wednesday to relief flights only, with U.N. agencies and dozens of nonprofits on standby to distribute basic goods.\n\ntoggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP\n\n\"The devastation is enormous,\" he said. \"We need all hands on deck to recover stronger and to help those in need at this time.\"\n\nThe United States is sending rescue and response teams to assist in recovery efforts in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X.\n\nSt. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto told Nationwide News Network on Wednesday that authorities have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. One death was reported in the west when a tree fell on a baby, state minister Abka Fitz-Henley told Nationwide News Network.\n\nBefore landfall, Melissa had already been blamed for three deaths in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMelissa devastates Haitian town\n\nHurricane Melissa damaged more than 160 homes and destroyed 80 others in the town of Petit-Goâve, where 10 of the 20 people killed there were children, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday.\n\nLawyer Charly Saint-Vil, 30, said he saw bodies lying among the debris after the storm as he walked the streets of the small coastal town where he grew up. People screamed as they searched for their missing children, he said.\n\n\"People have lost everything,\" Saint-Vil said.\n\nAlthough the immediate threat of the storm has passed, Saint-Vil said Petit-Goâve's residents were living in fear about access to medicine, water and food in the coming days given the political instability in Haiti.\n\n\"We don't know what will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nFor now, neighbors are helping one another source necessities and find places to sleep. Saint-Vil is hosting a number of friends who lost their homes in his small apartment.\n\n\"What I can do, I will do it, but it's not easy because the situation is really complicated for everyone,\" he said.\n\nCuba rides out the storm\n\nPeople in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier.\n\n\"Life is what matters,\" Alexis Ramos, a 54-year-old fisherman, said as he surveyed his destroyed home and shielded himself from the intermittent rain with a yellow raincoat. \"Repairing this costs money, a lot of money.\"\n\nLocal media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground.\n\n\"As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery. We are ready,\" President Miguel Díaz-Canel wrote on X.\n\nThe hurricane could worsen Cuba's severe economic crisis, which already has led to prolonged power blackouts along with fuel and food shortages.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCuba's National Institute of Hydraulic Resources reported accumulated rainfall of 15 inches (38 centimeters) in Charco Redondo and 14 inches (36 centimeters) in Las Villas Reservoir.\n\nWednesday night Melissa had top sustained winds of 90 mph (150 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 16 mph (26 kph) according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. The hurricane was centered about 65 miles (100 kilometers) east of the central Bahamas and about 860 miles (1,385 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda.\n\nAuthorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago's southeast corner ahead of Melissa's arrival.\n\nMelissa's center is forecast to move through southeastern Bahamas later Wednesday, generating up to 7 feet (2 meters) of storm surge in the area. By late Thursday, Melissa is expected to pass just west of Bermuda."

Impact Link\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a Wednesday evening conversation with Jordan Senior, 36, a rental-property owner and operator in Treasure Beach, Jamaica. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified the financial details in this story.\n\nI'm family with most people in Treasure Beach, Jamaica. I've lived here for years, and I work in the hospitality industry, running short-term rentals.\n\nAs a Jamaican local, I'm no stranger to hurricanes. I was here during Hurricane Ivan. I was here for Beryl in 2024. I lost the roof on my home during Beryl.\n\nWe were stressed about Hurricane Melissa. Authorities told us it would be a Category Five hurricane.\n\nThey said, \"We've never had a hurricane like this before. It's going to wreck the place. Prepare, prepare, prepare.\"\n\nWhen it finally arrived, it wasn't the worst I've lived through, but it was rough. I sheltered at home with my wife, and the wind and rain were so strong that we couldn't see anything.\n\nOutside our window, it was all just white — a white spray of water everywhere.\n\nWhen it died down, I took stock of the rental cabin that is my primary source of income. It is just a short distance from my home, and the flooding around it was the worst I've ever seen.\n\nCashaw Cabin\n\nJordan Senior's A-frame cabin in Treasure Beach, before the flooding. Jordan Senior\n\nI built Cashaw Cabin, a one-bedroom A-frame cabin with a private pool five minutes from Treasure Beach, in 2022 and opened it for business in 2023. I invested about $40,000 in the property.\n\nIt has a small kitchenette, a full bathroom, a patio, a back garden, and a plunge pool, and is perfect for two people.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nAcross the year, it's booked about 15 to 20 nights a month, but from mid-November to May, it's booked out almost every night.\n\nI rent it for about $115 to $150 per night, depending on the time of the year, on platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, and Expedia. Apart from my photography gig, it's my primary source of income, and I earn around $30,000 yearly from it.\n\nGuests have described it as rustic chic and said they felt like they were on an island by themselves in the cabin.\n\nHurricane damage\n\nJordan Senior's cabin has suffered massive flooding from the hurricane. Jordan Senior\n\nAfter Hurricane Melissa, it looks like it's been submerged in the sea.\n\nThe flooding is up to my knee, and it's impossible to enter the cabin. The landscaping has been wiped clean.\n\nThe water is slowly going down, so I just have to wait and see. But I don't think I will be in a position to reopen it to guests for at least a month and a half, maybe even January.\n\nAirbnb has canceled my bookings. I understand, that's no problem, they have to look after people.\n\nBut at the same time, maybe the host needs some help, too. If you're canceling bookings months after a storm, that doesn't really work out for the hosts because we don't have anything to look forward to in terms of earnings.\n\nI'm trying to get this thing ready so I can host again as soon as possible.\n\nA new property that's set back by months\n\nJordan Senior's new two-bedroom villa has been severely damaged. Jordan Senior\n\nI was using the earnings from Cashaw Cabin to partially fund another construction project, a two-bedroom villa. It was almost ready to start operations. If not for the hurricane, it would have been up in a couple of weeks.\n\nThis villa and two other properties I'm building have cost me about $60,000, which I've funded from my savings and with a family investor.\n\nSenior's new villa was almost ready before the hurricane, which damaged it severely. Jordan Senior\n\nThe unit is largely destroyed. The frame is still there, but the roof is gone, and something hit the wall and smashed it up. So that has to be repaired again, because all the work that's already been done has been annihilated.\n\nThe money I was going to spend on the final touches on the property and its launch will now have to be used for repair work. I'll have to dip even further into my savings now.\n\nPhysically, I'm OK. Mentally, I'm exhausted.\n\nRepresentatives for Airbnb, Booking.com, and Expedia did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAirbnb has a major disruptive events policy that guides how it handles cancellations and refunds. Hurricanes in the Caribbean Sea are in its list of \"most common foreseeable weather events.\" Affected Airbnb hosts in the region can cancel reservations without paying fees, per Airbnb's website.\n\nIn a press release on Wednesday, Airbnb said it would offer free emergency housing for Hurricane Melissa first responders in affected Caribbean countries, including Jamaica."

At that strength, it would be the strongest hurricane to hit the island since record-keeping began in 1851.\n\nBlamed for six deaths in the northern Caribbean as it headed toward the island, Melissa was on track to make landfall Tuesday in Jamaica before coming ashore in Cuba later in the day and then heading toward the Bahamas. It was not expected to affect the United States.\n\nAnticipating the hardship in store for his country, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said, \"I have been on my knees in prayer.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHanna Mcleod, a 23-year-old hotel receptionist in the Jamaican capital of Kingston, said she boarded up the windows at her home, where her husband and brother are staying. She stocked up on canned corned beef and mackerel and left candles and flashlights throughout the house.\n\n\"I just told them to keep the door closed,\" she said. \"I am definitely worried. This is actually the first time I'll be experiencing this type of hurricane.\"\n\nCategory 5 is the top of the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, with sustained winds exceeding 157 mph. Melissa would be the strongest hurricane in recorded history to directly hit the small Caribbean nation, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\ntoggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nA storm surge of up to 13 feet was expected along coastal Kingston, which Porter said is home to critical infrastructure such as Jamaica's main international airport and power plants.\n\n\"This can become a true humanitarian crisis very quickly, and there is likely going to be the need for a lot of international support,\" Porter said in a phone interview.\n\nSystem has winds of 175 mph\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Melissa was centered about 145 miles southwest of Kingston and about 325 miles southwest of Guantánamo, Cuba.

Two people died in Jamaica over the weekend as they cut trees ahead of the storm.\n\n\"It's nothing to play with,\" said Water and Environment Minister Matthew Samuda. \"The time for preparation is all but over.\"\n\nMore than 50,000 customers were without power. Landslides, fallen trees and downed power lines were reported ahead of the storm.\n\nIn eastern Cuba, a hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCuban officials said they would evacuate more than 600,000 people from the region, including Santiago, the island's second-largest city. Long bus lines formed in some areas.\n\nEvan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service, warned that cleanup and damage assessment would be severely delayed because of anticipated landslides, flooding and blocked roads.\n\nA storm of Category 4 or higher has not made landfall in Jamaica in 174 years of record-keeping. Hurricane Gilbert was a Category 3 storm when it hit the island in 1988. Hurricanes Ivan and Beryl were both Category 4, but they did not make landfall, Thompson said.\n\nJamaican government officials said they were worried that fewer than 1,000 people were in the more than 880 shelters open across the island.\n\n\"It's way, way below what is required for a Category 5 hurricane,\" said Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's transport minister, who urged people \"to be smart ... If you are not, unfortunately, you will pay the consequences.\"\n\nDrenching rain in the Dominican Republic and Haiti\n\nThe storm already has drenched the Dominican Republic, where schools and government offices were ordered to remain closed on Monday in four of nine provinces still under red alert.\n\nMelissa damaged more than 750 homes across the country and displaced more than 3,760 people. Floodwaters also have cut access to at least 48 communities, officials said.\n\nIn neighboring Haiti, the storm destroyed crops in three regions, including 15 hectares (37 acres) of maize at a time when at least 5.7 million people, more than half of the country's population, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger.\n\n\"Flooding is obstructing access to farmland and markets, jeopardizing harvests and the winter agricultural season,\" the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an above-normal season with 13 to 18 named storms."
