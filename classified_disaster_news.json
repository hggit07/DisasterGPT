Triggered by a rare cyclone in November, the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. \"Does the central government not know [what we're experiencing]? I don't understand,\" a tearful Ismail A Jalil said in front of cameras. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is \"under control\". \"Indonesia is capable of overcoming this disaster,\" he told his cabinet last week. Prabowo has also ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts.\n\nPrabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he won in February 2024 on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over mass food poisonings. In August and September, thousands of Indonesians took to the streets over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Many in Aceh still do not have ready access to clean water, food and electricity\n\nDesperate calls for help\n\nLast Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: \"I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world.\" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. \"The flags do not mean we are giving in. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,\" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, told the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. Survivors have spoken of sickness and starvation. \"How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,\" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring that he welcomes help \"from anyone, anywhere\". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a \"national scale\", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts.\n\nDisaster strikes again\n\nFor some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. Aceh, already ravaged by decades of civil war, was among the hardest-hit. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects. \"Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added. Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods - but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government.\n\nGetty Images Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch"

Her family is still displaced after the war and waiting for reconstruction to begin. \"Here we are, living a life of humiliation,\" she told the BBC. \"We want caravans. We want our homes rebuilt. We long for concrete to keep us warm. Every day I sit and cry for my children.\"\n\nTwo months into an American-imposed ceasefire, Gaza is stuck in the first phase of Donald Trump's peace plan - its territory divided between the warring parties, its people still displaced and surrounded by rubble. Heavy rain has deluged camps and led several buildings to collapse, as a powerful winter storm sweeps through the Strip. More than 800,000 Gazans are at risk from flooding, the UN says.\n\nGhadir al-Adham is longing to move her children into a solid home\n\nSticking point\n\nPlans for new homes - and new government - lie frozen in the next stage of US President Donald Trump's peace deal, as the search continues for Israel's last missing hostage, Ran Gvili. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has insisted Hamas must return all Israel's hostages – living and dead – before the two sides move on to the next, more difficult, stage of the peace deal. But several searches of Gaza's rubble have so far shown no sign of him. Mr Gvili was captured during the 7 October Hamas attacks - a police officer, recovering from a broken shoulder, who went to defend nearby kibbutz Alumim.\n\nHandout Yellow flags have been hung for Ran Gvili near his home in southern Israel\n\nHis parents, Talik and Itzik, were told last year he had not survived. The road to their home in Meitar, in southern Israel, is lined with banners paying tribute to him, the yellow flags of remembrance for Israel's hostages fluttering alongside. \"They stole our kid, they stole him,\" his mother Talik told me. \"They know where he is,\" Itzik said. \"They just try to hide or keep him. They're play[ing] with us.\" They believe Hamas wants to keep their son as an insurance policy against future negotiations, after returning all the other hostages, both living and dead.\n\nItzik Gvili (right) accuses Hamas of trying to hide his son\n\nIn response, a Hamas official told the BBC their allegations were untrue, and that Israel was trying to avoid implementing the agreement. But with no sign of Ran's body, and pressure from Washington growing, his parents say they are counting on Israel's leaders not to move forward before their son is found. \"Everyone in Israel['s] government says to us, 'No, we don't move to the second level until Ran comes back.' This is their promise,\" Talik said. Many in Israel believe it would be politically difficult for Netanyahu to carry out the next steps in the deal, including withdrawing Israeli forces further back towards Gaza's perimeter, if even one hostage is still missing in Gaza.\n\nTime 'running out'\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas face difficult concessions in the next stage of the deal. For Hamas, it means handing over weapons and power. For Israel, handing over security to an international stabilisation force. And this is also why leaders on both sides may be hesitating, says retired General Israel Ziv, a former head of Israel's military Operations Directorate. \"Israel and Hamas are sharing the same interests not to move so fast into the second stage,\" he told me. \"Hamas doesn't want to lose control, and the Israeli side for political reasons also prefer to stay in Gaza, as nobody wants to explain to their base that they have to withdraw.\" He says Trump is the only one who can force the two sides forward, and that time is running out.\n\n\"By waiting I think we might miss the opportunity because Hamas is reorganising and [its] strength is coming back,\" he explained. \"We have to take a deep breath and go forward with that plan, because staying in the situation as it is, it's the worst-case scenario.\" Disarming Hamas – in a way both sides will accept – is seen as the first major hurdle. Without that, no foreign countries are likely to commit troops to secure the Strip, and no reconstruction is likely to begin in Hamas-controlled areas. Earlier this week, Netanyahu suggested he was sceptical that foreign nations could complete the task in place of Israel. \"Our friends in America want to try to establish an international force that will do the job,\" he said. \"We know that there are certain tasks that this force can do. I don't want to go into detail, they can't do everything, and maybe they can't do the main thing, but we'll see.\"\n\nTrump eager to move fast\n\nGaza is currently divided in two by the \"yellow line\" marking the limits of Israeli forces under the first stage of the ceasefire deal.\n\nIsrael's military chief of staff recently referred to it as a \"new border line\", sparking accusations that Israel was signalling an intention to remain there long term. Key issues, including how to disarm Hamas, are due to be discussed at a meeting between Netanyahu and Trump in Florida later this month. The US president – who has already brokered a ceasefire in Gaza and pushed his peace plan through the UN Security Council – has been outspoken about his desire to move the process forward. He told journalists this week that he would announce the membership of a newly created Board of Peace for Gaza early next year. \"It will be one of the most legendary boards ever… Everybody wants to be on it,\" he said.\n\nGetty Images The floods make it hard for Gazans to keep children dry"

        "content": "Since 2020, scientists have installed monitoring instruments around the Barry Landslide in Alaska's Prince William Sound to closely track seismic activity in the area. Their goal is to detect warning signs early, before a sudden landslide could trigger a destructive tsunami.\n\nBy analyzing these seismic recordings, researchers identified a previously unrecognized type of signal. These events are marked by sharp, high-frequency pulses that become more common from late summer through mid-winter, then suddenly stop in late winter or early spring.\n\nStrange Signals Linked to Freezing and Thawing Rock\n\nWriting in Seismological Research Letters, Gabrielle Davy of the University of Alaska Fairbanks and her colleagues propose that the signals are caused by water freezing and thawing inside tiny cracks in the rock beneath the nearby Cascade Glacier. The research team is the first to carry out a systematic analysis of these short, impulsive seismic events near the Barry Landslide.\n\nThe scientists emphasize that these signals are not signs that the landslide itself is moving. However, they may still provide valuable insight into changes in underground water conditions behind the slope. Those changes could eventually play a role in triggering slope movement.\n\nWhy the Barry Landslide Poses a Serious Risk\n\nSearching for seismic warning signs at Barry Arm is especially important because the landslide sits in a highly unstable setting. The slope is steep and underlain by weak, heavily fractured bedrock, making it prone to failure. It has also lost critical support from Barry Glacier, which has rapidly melted and retreated over the last century.\n\n\"What makes Barry Landslide especially concerning is the size of the landslide,\" Davy explained. \"It's a large, slowly moving mass -- on the order of about 500 million cubic meters -- that has been creeping for decades.\"\n\n\"If a rapid collapse were to occur, the material would fall directly into the fjord, and that could generate a tsunami with potentially high wave heights,\" she added. \"Barry Arm is visited by kayakers and cruise ships, and nearby communities such as Whittier could be affected, so understanding the hazard is important from both a scientific and a public-safety perspective.\"\n\nSorting Through a Year of Seismic Data\n\nBecause of these risks, the landslide area has been extensively instrumented since 2020. The study by Davy and her colleagues is among the first to carefully examine the large volume of seismic data collected by those instruments.\n\nFor this research, the team manually reviewed an entire year of continuous seismic waveform recordings. They searched for signals that might help determine when and where a landslide could occur.\n\nThis hands-on approach allowed the researchers to recognize the wide range of signals present in the data. These included vibrations from small earthquakes, glacier motion, slope deformation, and other sources of seismic background noise.\n\n\"We needed to build a clear baseline understanding of the types of signals that routinely occur in the area, so that any unusual or previously unrecognized signals would stand out. By spending time with the raw data, you train your eye to recognize what 'normal' looks like\" before developing classification tools and detection algorithms, Davy explained.\n\nSeasonal Patterns Reveal a Freeze-Thaw Process\n\nAfter learning how to identify the unusual short-impulsive events in the seismic records, the researchers compared them with weather and rainfall data. They also used ground-based radar to track subtle changes in slope movement. This combination allowed them to study when and where the signals occurred.\n\nThe timing, location, and characteristics of the signals pointed to small, brittle events that happen seasonally as water freezes and thaws inside cracks in the rock.\n\n\"Similar seismic signals have been documented in other settings, although they are not widely reported,\" Davy said. She pointed to a recent study from Norway that observed comparable signals near an unstable rock slope and \"suggested that their signals may be linked to freeze-thaw processes acting on cracks within the bedrock.\"\n\nToward Better Landslide Early Warning Systems\n\nCo-author Ezgi Karasözen said the Alaska Earthquake Center is now testing a regional landslide detection system at the Barry Landslide site. According to Karasözen, the system \"will alert us to any slope failures in this area.\"\n\n\"As research on landslide seismology grows, there's increasing recognition that precursor seismic activity -- when it does occur -- can be an important source of early warning,\" Karasözen said. \"That motivates broader investigations not only at Barry Arm, but also at other sites in southern Alaska where similar hazards exist.\""

Lower rainfall totals could still trigger flash flooding and it can unfold very quickly.\n\n\"With as much total rain as what we're expecting, widespread, significant flooding will likely occur in urban and poor drainage areas, especially in and around the higher terrain,\" National Weather Service at Oxnard Meteorologist-In-Charge Ariel Cohen said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon. \"There will almost certainly be numerous rock slides and mudslides, along with areas of severe flooding in urban locations and along freeways, which is why being out on the roads will be exceptionally dangerous.\"\n\nRainfall that would normally be absorbed into the ground, instead remains as runoff and can trigger dangerous and significant flash flooding quickly, especially downstream and downhill from a wildfire burn scar area.\n\nThe National Weather Service highlights that in some instances, burned soil can be as water repellant as pavement, A general rule of thumb is that half an inch of rainfall in less than an hour is sufficient to cause flash flooding in a burn area. The susceptibility to flash flood within the burned area is greatest during the first two years following the fire.\n\nIn recent years, parts of California have been experiencing a shift from major drought stages to an extended period of above-average precipitation, which allowed for abundant vegetation growth.\n\nIn this Feb. 13, 2025, file photo, heavy rains created a mud filled debris flow sending cars down Tanoble Drive onto Mendocino Street in the Eaton fire burn area, in Altadena, Calif. Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images, FILE\n\nHydroclimate whiplash -- the rapid shift between wet and dry conditions -- likely contributed to the severity of the wildfires burning in Southern California, experts say.\n\nFlood impacts include significant and widespread urban roadway flooding, a high risk of major mudslides and rockslides and rapid rises to creeks, streams and rivers, which will likely lead to swiftwater rescues.\n\nResidents should expect major travel delays, cancellations and road closures.\n\nMuch of California also faces strong winds beginning Tuesday night. The winds will be strongest in the higher elevations and mountains.\n\nWhile the dangerous flash flooding threat is centered over southern California, the northern half of the state will face the brunt of the strong winds in the coming days.\n\nHigh wind warnings have been issued for cities such as Sacramento, Redding, Santa Barbara, and Santa Clarita. Wind gusts of 60-70 mph are possible in these areas, bringing the threat of power outages and wind damage. Isolated gusts over 70 mph are possible in some of the mountains.\n\nWind advisories are in effect for many of the major cities along the coast, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego with winds gusts of 40-50+ mph possible.\n\nABC News' Dan Peck contributed to this report."

        "content": "What does climate change look like? This year's hurricane season is one example\n\ntoggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nThe 2025 hurricane season was a study in contrasts.\n\nIn one way, it felt very quiet in the United States. No storms made landfall in the U.S. for the first time since 2015. And, for about three weeks in the middle of the hurricane season, no storms formed at all in the Atlantic.\n\nAnd yet, the storms that did form were among the most powerful hurricanes ever recorded.\n\n\"The one word I would pick for it is 'unusual',\" says Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. In 2025, the total number of tropical storms and hurricanes, 13, was about average. But a lot of those storms ended up being massive Category 5 behemoths.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We had three Category five hurricanes this year, which is the second most in a single season behind only the super hyperactive 2005 season,\" says Lindsey Long, a meteorologist with the Climate Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The infamous 2005 Atlantic hurricane season included hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. The fact that none of this year's storms made landfall in the U.S. was just luck, Long says.\n\nYears like this one, with an average number of overall storms, but an above-average cohort of very powerful hurricanes, are getting more likely because of climate change.\n\nThat's mainly because global warming is causing ocean temperatures to rise dramatically. Planet-warming pollution — most of which comes from burning oil, gas and coal — traps huge amounts of extra heat in the atmosphere. Most of that extra heat is absorbed by the oceans.\n\nThe part of the Atlantic ocean where hurricanes form has experienced record-breaking heat over the last few years.\n\n\"That water is kind of fuel for hurricanes,\" Long says. \"It helps dictate how intense the storm will be.\"\n\nThat's what happened this year with Hurricane Melissa . The storm moved over abnormally warm water as it gained strength, ultimately making landfall in Jamaica as a devastating Category 5 hurricane in late October. The Atlantic hurricane season extends from June 1 to Nov. 30.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt the same time, wind patterns can break storms apart. Wind shear, which happens when there's a big difference in wind speed high in the atmosphere versus down lower, makes it difficult for storms to form. Long says there was quite a bit of wind shear this year, which kept the total number of storms average.\n\nClimate computer models suggest that there will be more wind shear in the part of the Atlantic where hurricanes form as the Earth continues to warm.\n\nTaken together, that means a hotter planet will likely mean fewer total hurricanes, but higher percentage will be large, powerful storms .\n\nThe 2025 season \"happens to fit that mold extremely well,\" McNoldy says.\n\nNot every hurricane season will look like this. Even though the climate is steadily warming, and ocean temperatures are consistently above-average in the Atlantic, there's still a lot of variability in how many storms form and how powerful they get in any given year."

It seeks to recover economic damages incurred by the state and prevent the company from passing those costs on to customers.\n\nThe Smokehouse Creek fire killed three people in 2024, burning through more than 1,500 square miles (3,885 square kilometers) in Texas before spilling into neighboring Oklahoma. Texas A&M Forest Service investigators determined it was ignited when a decayed utility pole snapped and fell, dropping Xcel power lines onto dry grass.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Minnesota-based company has acknowledged its equipment appeared to have sparked the wildfire. But the lawsuit claims the company had neglected to replace aging utility poles in the windswept Panhandle, some of which were nearly 100 years old and more than twice their typical lifespan of 40 years.\n\n“Xcel’s blatant negligence killed three Texans and caused unfathomable destruction in the Texas Panhandle,” Paxton said. “The company made false representations about its safety commitments and ignored warnings that its aging infrastructure needed immediate repair and to be updated.”\n\nThe fatalities related to the fire included a woman who was overtaken by flames after getting out of her truck, and another woman whose remains were found in her burned home. A fire chief in one of the hardest hit towns died while responding to a house fire.\n\nThe company disputed Paxton's claims of negligence and noted it had already accepted responsibility for equipment failure. Xcel said it has already paid out more than $361 million to settle 212 of 254 claims.\n\n“When the Attorney General’s office approached us earlier this year requesting information, we worked with them in good faith to try and find a consensus solution,” Xcel said in a statement. \"They chose to file litigation instead. We will review this litigation and vigorously defend ourselves against these allegations.”"

        "content": "The song \"Landslide\" by Fleetwood Mac was recorded in 1975 but wasn't released as a single until 1997 (a live version). Still, it became a classic for its wistful, melancholy melody and poetic lyrics. Stevie Nicks wrote the song as she contemplated her future with or without Lindsey Buckingham. Sure, she was looking at the Rocky Mountains, but a landslide was simply a metaphor. Nicks ultimately ended their romantic relationship but continued to work with Buckingham, which proved to be the right choice.\n\n\n\nBut what if the song were about a real landslide, an avalanche, a natural disaster? Dustin Ballard, also known as There I Ruined It (previously at Neatorama) collaborated with guest songwriters Griefcat to make it so. Now the subject matter is completely at odds with the laid-back tune, but they match the title at least. And now we have a There I Ruined It song you can share with your mother."

        "content": "Ace Aguirre was just two bites into his oatmeal on the morning of November 4 when he noticed something strange: mud had seeped onto the living room floor of his bungalow in Cotcot, a village in the Philippines’ Cebu province.\n\nThe moments that followed will be forever seared into Aguirre’s memory. His living room furniture floating; the terrifying few minutes when he wasn’t sure he’d be able to pry the front door open; his son praying to God as the water rose to their chests; his daughter, who can’t swim, perched high on a pillar as water and cars gushed by, inches from her feet.\n\n“I don’t know how we were able to survive. One detail that didn’t go our way and many of us could have died,” Aguirre told CNN.\n\nThat morning Typhoon Kalmaegi dumped over a month’s worth of rain, causing rivers and waterways in Cebu to swell and unleashing catastrophic flash flooding that killed more than 230 people nationwide.\n\nOne of the dead was Aguirre’s neighbor, a mother of two, who drowned when she became trapped in her kitchen. He had tried to save her but couldn’t get her out in time.\n\nTorrential downpours and deadly flooding in the tropical, disaster-prone Philippines are not new. But revelations in recent months that politicians, officials and contractors had looted billions of dollars from the nationwide program supposed to mitigate their effects have roiled the country.\n\nAguirre's daughter faces rising floodwaters on November 4 in her village of Cotcot, Liloan, in the Philippines' Cebu province. Virnalyn Catipay\n\nPrior to the deadly flooding, a citizens’ group in Cebu had called for an audit of flood control projects along the Cotcot River, upstream from where Aguirre lives, according to local media.\n\nThe scandal has embroiled dozens of high-ranking lawmakers and officials who allegedly received kickbacks to award contracts. Those revelations have sparked huge youth-led anti-government protests against corruption and wealthy elites, similar to those seen this year in Indonesia and Nepal.\n\nAguirre had been watching the political drama unfold far away in Manila, the capital, for months, but he didn’t expect it to come to his doorstep.\n\n“All of a sudden you become a direct victim,” he said. “It hits different.”\n\nThe flooding in November prompted Cebu’s governor Pamela Baricuatro to demand an investigation into the 26 billion pesos ($443 million) in flood-control projects in the province which officials in Manila admitted “should have been working” by the time disaster struck.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. later visited the region and promised to clear and clean the waterways, and de-clog drainage systems, in time for rainy season next year.\n\nThe previous July he had revealed a government flood control program worth more than 545 billion pesos ($9.2 billion) had been plagued by corruption.\n\nHe said an internal audit found many of the 10,000 projects his government had overseen since he came to power in 2022 had been built using substandard materials or not at all, he said, referring to the projects as “ghost projects.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Philippine government for comment.\n\nWhen Marcos Jr exposed the fraud, he “opened a can of worms” that has since spun out of his control, said Sol Iglesias, associate professor of Political Science at the University of the Philippines.\n\nThis aerial photo shows damaged houses in the aftermath of Typhoon Kalmaegi in Talisay, in Cebu province on November 5, 2025. Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTestimonies in the House and Senate have revealed “an entire system of plunder and corruption that has been facilitated by the very agencies that were responsible for budgeting, planning, implementing, monitoring and checking on the financial soundness of these infrastructures,” Iglesias said.\n\nIn September, Finance Secretary Raph Recto told a Senate hearing up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2 billion) in funding for flood control may have been lost to corruption in the past two years, according to the Associated Press news agency.\n\nMarcos Jr has vowed to jail at least 37 congressmen and other officials responsible for the scams by Christmas, and seven have been thrown behind bars so far. The government has also frozen about 12 billion pesos ($204 million) in assets of individuals linked to the scandal.\n\nThe scandal has galvanized ordinary Filipinos, who have taken to the streets to protest decades of unchecked corruption.\n\n“This is the last straw for the Filipino people,” said Tiffany Faith Brillante, the head of Youth Rage Against Corruption in the Philippines, which has been involved in the protests.\n\nFilipino activists protest near the presidential palace on Human Rights Day in Manila, Philippines on December 10, 2025. Eloisa Lopez/Reuters\n\n“The corruption today is no longer just a symptom of weak governance,” she said. “It’s deeply rooted in how power is held in the government, how budgets are allocated, and how accountability is constantly avoided.”\n\nMarcos Jr has insisted he did not know of the fraud being perpetrated. He has positioned himself as a corruption crusader, shaming those responsible for the graft and egging on the protesters.\n\nBut as more top-ranking officials have become implicated in the scandal, some have pointed the finger back at the president.\n\nOne of those people is Zaldy Co, a one-time Marcos Jr ally and former House appropriations committee chairperson, who has become one of the central figures accused in the scandal. He fled the country and is currently a fugitive.\n\nWhile in hiding, he posted a series of explosive videos to his social media account, accusing Marcos Jr and his family members of profiting from the corruption – charges which the president has denied.\n\nMarcos’s family members have also been caught up in the drama. Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, a cousin of Marcos, resigned as House Speaker in September over the controversy, though he has denied any involvement in the scandal.\n\nBeyond the scale of the alleged theft, what has made this scandal hit so hard is that for many Filipinos it feels like history is repeating itself, said Aries Arugay, a Filipino political scientist and visiting senior fellow at the Singapore-based think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\n“Corruption and the Marcoses are almost synonyms in Philippine politics,” Arugay said.\n\nMarcos Jr’s father, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, ruled the Philippines with an iron fist from 1965 until his ouster in 1986, with the country living under martial law for about half that time. His regime committed systemic human rights abuses and engaged in widespread corruption, stealing an estimated $10 billion from public coffers.\n\nThe flood control scandal has reminded Filipinos of the dark days many experienced under Marcos Sr. One of the biggest anti-corruption protests was held on a significant date, September 21, when in 1972 Marcos Sr imposed martial law.\n\nMarcos Jr’s landslide victory in 2022 marked an extraordinary comeback for the notorious political family, which critics claimed was made possible in part by disinformation campaigns which whitewashed the history of the Marcos era.\n\nAnd though officials have warned the looting of the flood prevention program may have started under Marcos’ predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, the disparity between the lifestyles of the elite and regular Filipinos has been a source of anger under the current president.\n\nPhilippines' President Ferdinand Marcos Jr speaks during a press conference at Malacanang Palace in Manila on November 13, 2025. Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSocial media videos posted by the children of wealthy politicians and contractors flaunting their lavish lifestyles have added salt to the wounds of angry citizens, Arugay said.\n\n“When people are being submerged in flood water, the politicians are in Paris, riding their private jets,” he said.\n\nThis backlash against so-called “nepo kids” mirrors similar anti-corruption protests across Asia this year, including in Indonesia and Nepal, where Gen-Z led protests overthrew the government.\n\nLike those protests, young people have been some of the loudest voices calling for accountability in the Philippines.\n\n“We inherit the consequences of corruption and systemic abuse in our country if the government continues to steal, oppress and ignore the people,” Brillante said.\n\n“We really want to hold accountable and jail every single official involved in corruption,” Brillante said.\n\n“President Marcos cannot be spared, because at the end of the day, he’s the one who signs and approves the national budget every single year.”\n\nWhile public confidence in Marcos Jr has wavered, he’s not likely to meet the same fate as his father, who was unseated in a public uprising.\n\nMarcos Jr is more than halfway through his six-year term, and Philippine presidents have single term limits, so he will not be eligible for re-election in 2028.\n\n“We haven’t seen the equivalent of a smoking gun,” Iglesias said.\n\n“But if (we get) that smoking gun, for example, evidence of his directly benefitting financially from this corruption, then that will I think push the administration over the edge. Right now, it’s teetering.”\n\nFilipinos march alongside an effigy depicting Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr during a protest against corruption in Manila, Philippines on November 30, 2025. Lisa Marie David/Getty Images\n\nRecent public opinion polling by the firm WR Numero found Marcos Jr’s satisfaction rating was 21% in November, a 14% drop from August.\n\nFor someone who came so close to losing everything, Aguirre is upbeat and grateful. But he’s not optimistic that this wave of public momentum will produce any meaningful change in the Philippines.\n\n“With our resilience, we can still move forward, but the quality of life will still be the same.”"

The Minnesota State Patrol said the highway also was blocked in the southern part of that state,\n\nU.S 18 was closed indefinitely east of Clear Lake with what the O'Brien County sheriff reported on Facebook were accidents in both directions. The Iowa State Patrol said that across the state as of Sunday evening, it had investigated 31 crashes, one fatal and eight with injuries. It provided no details..\n\nIn addition to the 30 Iowa counties for which the weather service issued a blizzard warning, another county remains under a winter storm warning and a winter weather advisory is in effect south to the Interstate 80 and 29 corridors. The area includes the Des Moines and Ames metros, where a fast-developing snow squall brought a burst of snow that prompted the weather service to issue a warning of possible whiteout conditions.\n\nThe squall moved across the state, hitting Newton, Marshalltown, Grinnell and Waterloo before dissipating. Another snow squall hit Monona, Harrison and Shelby counties in western Iowa.\n\nThe blizzard warning is in effect through 9 a.m. Monday. It covers Blackhawk, Bremer, Butler, Calhoun, Cerro Gordo, Chickasaw, Clay, Dickinson, Emmet, Fayette, Floyd, Franklin, Grundy, Hamilton, Hancock, Hardin, Howard, Humboldt, Kossuth, Mitchell, O'Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Pocahontas, Sac, Webster, Winnebago, Winneshiek, Worth and Wright counties.\n\nThe winter storm warning, covering Allamakee County in extreme northeast Iowa, also has been extended to 9 a.m. The winter weather advisory for other Iowa counties is slated to expire at 6 a.m. in central Iowa south of Interstate 80. It will continue until 9 a.m. north of I-80, including Ames, and in the eastern part of the advisory area, including Iowa City.\n\nThe weather service said the counties in the blizzard warning area could expect 2 to 7 inches of snow with extremely high and gusting northwest winds, creating potential whiteout conditions. Estherville Municipal Airport reported a gust of 62 mph.\n\nThe winter storm warning covers an area extending into Wisconsin that could see 5 to 7 inches of snow by the time the storm ends. It also was experiencing high winds.\n\nRain preceded the snow in some areas, including central Iowa, and posed the potential for especially hazardous driving conditions as temperatures across the state quickly fell. The Iowa State Patrol and Iowa Department of Transportation warned untreated roads could quickly become coated with ice.\n\n\"Anticipate challenging to dangerous travel today and tonight, with travel discouraged in northern Iowa,\" the weather service said.\n\nSnow and high winds expected in central and eastern Iowa\n\nIn the Des Moines and Iowa City metros and other areas farther south, snow accumulation was expected to range from less than half an inch to an inch or more. Winds there also were high, with Des Moines International Airport reporting a gust of 53 mph.\n\nTemperatures on Sunday in central and eastern Iowa started the day in the 40s but had dropped to a low of about 10 degrees by 8 p.m. Windchill made them feel like -8, the weather service said.\n\nFather north, with ambient temperatures well below zero, windchill was expected to make them feel as low as -20 degrees.\n\nCold and wind to linger as week begins\n\nThe weather service said sunshine should return Monday, but with a high of 20 in central Iowa and continued wind until the evening. The low is expected to be a blustery 13 degrees.\n\nTuesday could bring a bit of a warmup, with a high of 37 and a low of 26 in the evening as clouds move in.\n\nWednesday's forecast calls for cloudy skies with a high of 34 and a low of 16, and New Year's Day will be partly sunny and colder, with a high of 26 and a low around 15.\n\nFarther east, beyond Iowa's borders, conditions could be more extreme as the week begins, with a blizzard warning issued for parts of the Great Lakes region Monday, the weather service said.\n\nPolk County to activate extreme temperature plan\n\nIn response to Sunday's forecast, Polk County Emergency Management activated its extreme temperature plan at 4 p.m. Sunday. The county activates the plan when temperatures reach certain thresholds: 10 degrees with wind chill for three or more days, 5 degrees with wind chill for two or more days or 0 degrees or less with wind chill for at least one day.\n\nThe plan includes weather amnesty at Central Iowa Shelter and Services, temporarily removing limitations on shelter nights; the opening of warming centers across the metro; and free transportation to the centers via DART bus service.\n\nWhere are warming shelters in Des Moines and central Iowa?\n\nWarming centers in Des Moines include:\n\nDes Moines Scott-Four Mile Community Recreation Center , 3711 Easton Blvd.\n\n3711 Easton Blvd. South Side Library , 1111 Porter Ave.\n\n1111 Porter Ave. Central Library, 1000 Grand Ave.\n\nForest Avenue Library,1326 Forest Ave.\n\nNorthwest Community Center, 5110 Franklin Ave.\n\nPolk County Health Department, 1907 Carpenter Ave.\n\nA full list of available warming centers can be found on the Polk County website, polkcountyiowa.gov.

Annabelle Chih/Getty Images\n\nTaiwan needs to focus on having the right weapons to deter and, if necessary, fight China in an full-scale war, a former top Taiwanese defense official said. Annabelle Chih/Getty Images\n\nTo prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nChina's grey-zone activities include regular military drills that practice blockades and invasions of Taiwan. GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan has ramped up military exercises focused on island defenses, including a large one earlier this year. Anadolu/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome."
