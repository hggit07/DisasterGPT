The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31mi), about 80km off the coast of the Aomori region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It prompted tsunami warnings which have now been lifted, while waves of 70cm (27in) were seen. Some train services have been suspended and thousands of homes have been left without power as a result. Authorities have also warned that a stronger tremor could occur in the coming days - urging the public to remain on high alert for at least a week, according to local media reports.\n\nEPA A car is stranded on a collapsed road in Tohoku, Northern Japan\n\nAddressing citizens affected by the earthquake, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said: \"Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking.\" Orders were issued for about 90,000 residents to evacuate, according to Reuters news agency. The Aomori prefectural government said around 2,700 homes have been left without power. East Japan Railway has also suspended some services along the north-eastern coast. The Japanese government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre and convened an emergency team, chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara has said. \"We are making every effort to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures, including rescue and relief operations,\" he added. Following the tremors, Japanese electric company Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said. None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency. Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011. That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.\n\nEPA This home in Aomori prefecture was among those affected by the earthquake"

Employees who stayed on endured a tumultuous year, to say the least, at the National Weather Service (NWS). A series of strong storms brewed in the Atlantic this season. But for the first time in a decade, no hurricane made landfall in the US — sparing most Americans the worst of the season.\n\n“That was a much needed break.”\n\n“That was a much needed break,” Neil Jacobs, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) administrator, said in a November 25 press release.\n\nThis was a season of “striking contrast,” according to NOAA, which encompasses the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center. After a relatively quiet start, there were sudden “bursts of intense activity.”\n\nAs far as the number of storms, it was a pretty average season with 13 named storms, five hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. Those major hurricanes, however, were doozies. Three reached Category 5 strength, with the most severe winds on the Saffir-Simpson scale. That puts this year in the second top spot on record for Category 5 storms in a single season.\n\nWarmer sea surface temperatures provide more heat energy for tropical storms, leading to hurricanes that are more intense than they would have been without climate change. “The storms that formed just exploded in their extreme rapid intensification,” Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist and vice president for engagement at nonprofit research group Climate Central, said in a Covering Climate Now press briefing earlier this month.\n\nAnother Category 5 storm, Hurricane Erin, caused erosion along a vast swath of the east coast from Massachusetts to North Carolina in August, according to Woods Placky. In September, Category 5 storm Humberto and Hurricane Imelda plunged several North Carolina coastal homes into the Atlantic without ever making landfall.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season kicks up again in June of next year, although early spring storms have been enough to lead the World Meteorological Organization to consider moving the start date up into May in recent years."

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck off northern Japan late Monday, injuring 23 people and triggering a tsunami in Pacific coast communities, officials said. Authorities warned of possible aftershocks and an increased risk of a megaquake.\n\nThe Japanese government was still assessing damages from the tsunami and late-evening quake, which struck at about 11:15 p.m. in the Pacific Ocean, around 80 kilometers (50 miles) off the coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan’s main Honshu island.\n\n“I’ve never experienced such a big shaking,” convenience store owner Nobuo Yamada told the public broadcaster NHK in the Aomori prefecture town of Hachinohe, adding that “luckily” power lines were still operating in his area.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA tsunami of up to 70 centimeters (2 feet, 4 inches) was measured in Kuji port in Iwate prefecture, just south of Aomori, and tsunami levels of up to 50 centimeters struck other coastal communities in the region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.\n\nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 23 people were injured, including one seriously. Most of them were hit by falling objects, NHK reported, adding that several people were injured in a hotel in Hachinohe and a man in Tohoku was slightly hurt when his car fell into a hole.\n\nThe meteorological agency reported the quake's magnitude as 7.5, down from its earlier estimate of 7.6. It issued an alert for potential tsunami surges of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in some areas and later downgraded to an advisory.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara urged residents to go to higher ground or seek shelter until advisories were lifted. He said about 800 homes were without electricity, and that the Shinkansen bullet trains and some local lines were suspended in parts of the region.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNuclear power plants in the region were conducting safety checks, Kihara said. The Nuclear Regulation Authority said about 450 liters (118 gallons) of water spilled from a spent fuel cooling area at the Rokkasho fuel reprocessing plant in Aomori, but that its water level remained within the normal range and there was no safety concern.\n\nAbout 480 residents were taking shelter at the Hachinohe Air Base, and 18 defense helicopters were mobilized for a damage assessment, Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said.\n\nAbout 200 passengers were stranded for the night at New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido, NHK reported.\n\nThe meteorological agency issued a caution about possible aftershocks in the coming days. It said there is a slight increase in risk of a magnitude 8-level quake and possible tsunami occurring along Japan's northeastern coast from Chiba, just east of Tokyo, to Hokkaido. The agency urged residents in 182 municipalities in the area to monitor their emergency preparedness in the coming week.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSatoshi Kato, a vice principal of a public high school in Hachinohe, told NHK that he was at home when the quake struck, and that glasses and bowls fell and smashed into shards on the floor.\n\nKato said he drove to the school because it was designated an evacuation center, and on the way he encountered traffic jams and car accidents as panicked people tried to flee. Nobody had yet come to the school to take shelter, he said.\n\nPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in brief comments to reporters that the government set up an emergency task force to urgently assess the extent of damage. “We are putting people’s lives first and doing everything we can,” she said.\n\nLater, she urged residents in the region to pay attention to the latest information from local municipalities. “Please be prepared so you can immediately evacuate as soon as you feel a tremor.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe quake struck about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Hachinohe, and about 50 kilometers (30 miles) below the sea surface, the meteorological agency said.\n\nIt was just north of the Japanese coast that suffered the magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in 2011 that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.\n\n“You need to prepare, assuming that a disaster like that could happen again,\" the meteorological agency's earthquake and volcano division official Satoshi Harada said.\n\nAt 6:20 a.m. on Tuesday morning, authorities lifted all tsunami advisories for the Pacific coastline in northern Japan, NHK said.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey reported another earthquake, with a magnitude 5.1, early on Tuesday, about 122 kilometers (76 miles) south of Honcho, at a depth of 35 kilometers.

The tremor, which struck shortly after 23:23, was felt across Lancashire and the southern Lake District, including the towns of Kendal and Ulverston, within 12 miles (19 km) of the epicentre which is believed to be Silverdale in Lancashire. Nikki Maddox, who runs the Blossom Bird coffee shop in Silverdale said she thought her roof was caving in when the tremors started. \"I had just climbed into bed and I heard this enormous rumble. It shook the whole house, it was very, very terrifying,\" she said.\n\nNikki Maddox, who runs the Blossom Bird coffee shop in Silverdale, said she was going to open as usual following the earthquake\n\nMs Maddox, who lives above the shop with her son, said the earthquake lasted about 20 seconds and the noise was \"deafening\". \"It lasted long enough for me to think 'oh no, the roof is caving in this is going to be expensive,' she said. \"We're about two floors up and the movement and the noise that came from the ground up was incredible, it was terrifying. \"It was deafening, my bed is against the wall and I could feel the wall shaking.\"\n\nSilverdale Parish Councillor Liz Unsworth said she had just returned from the village pantomime when the earthquake hit\n\nSilverdale Parish Councillor Liz Unsworth said it felt like her house was \"disintegrating\" around her. \"It was really scary,\" she said. \"I was relaxing before going to bed and I suddenly felt like my roof was falling in, the house was shaking. \"All my neighbours were outside, we didn't know what it was [at the time].\"\n\n'Hell of a scare'\n\nKatrina Simmons, who lives in Carnforth, 4.8 miles (7.7km) from the suspected epicentre, said she was woken in the night by the tremors. \"The shaking woke me up, I thought someone had driven into the house,\" she said. \"It was about 25 to 12 and I jumped straight out of bed. I live on my own so it gave me a hell of a scare,\" the Spar shop assistant added. \"It was only when I went on Facebook this morning I realised it was an earthquake. \"A customer this morning said all the emergency services were on standby at Aldi, at that time they thought it might have been an explosion. Someone said they could hear a helicopter circling.\" The quake occurred just off the coast of Silverdale at a depth of 1.86 miles, data suggested. There were no immediate reports of damage. Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said \"many residents felt or heard a loud bang\" in the area of Carnforth. Lancaster police also said it had received reports of a \"loud explosion\" in the area.\n\nTremors were felt within 12 miles of the epicentre which is believed to be Silverdale in Lancashire\n\nMs Simmons' colleague, Clare Hailes, from North Lancaster, said the force of the tremor set the shop's alarm off. \"I know the general manager got a call in the middle of the night because it set the alarms off,\" she said. \"Customers have been talking about it all morning. They thought a lorry had crashed into a building or there had been a quarry explosion. No-one was expecting it to be an earthquake.\" Lancashire Police said there had been a \"minor earthquake in the area, near to the Lancashire and Cumbria border, measuring 3.3 magnitude\". It added: \"There have been no reports of anyone injured or damage caused but we have officers in the area, together with colleagues from the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service and the North West Ambulance Service.\" The Volcano Discovery website said it had received more than 1,000 reports about the earthquake, with some as far away as Blackpool. One Carnforth resident posted on the site: \"Heard a rumbling sound which intensified in to a loud bang. Thought my roof was collapsing or something! Very scary.\" Another, in Silverdale, posted: \"Loud rumble and rattling of fixtures in house, as though something had collapsed or the chimney had fallen off. Significant enough to go outside to check.\" BGS detects about 300 earthquakes every year in the UK, but only about a tenth of these are felt or heard by people."

John Saeki and Nicholas Shearman/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDaiki Shimohata, 33, a civil servant in Hashikami on Honshu island, told Agence France-Presse that he and his family rushed outside their home.\n\n\"The tremor was something that we've never experienced. It lasted maybe for about 20 seconds,\" Shimohata said by phone.\n\n\"We were holding our children — a 2-year-old girl and a 1-year-old boy — in our arms. The shaking reminded me of the disaster (in 2011),\" he said.\n\nThe quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches — the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench — that have caused many large quakes in the past.\n\nA vehicle rests on the edge of a collapsed road in Tohoku town in Aomori Prefecture on Dec. 9, 2025, following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake off northern Japan. Jiji Press/AFP via Getty Images\n\nExperts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.\n\nIn explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.\n\nThe 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 50 feet in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.\n\nMegaquake could cause 98-foot tsunami and kill nearly 200,000\n\nAnother offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 98-foot tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.\n\nThe areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba Prefecture.\n\nJapan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.\n\nIn a 2013 damage estimate for a possible Nankai Trough megaquake, the government said a magnitude 9.1 quake could generate a tsunami exceeding 33 feet within minutes, killing as many as 323,000 people, destroying more than 2 million buildings and causing economic damage exceeding 200 trillion yen ($1.28 trillion) in the region.\n\nOfficials call on people to be calm and prepared\n\nOfficials are stressing that the latest advisory has no prediction for any megaquake happening at any specific time or location, a Cabinet official for disaster prevention, Tsukasa Morikubo, told a news conference early Tuesday. He called on residents to be cautious and prepared while continuing their daily activity and work.\n\nOfficials urge people to keep an emergency bag containing a few days' worth of daily necessities along with shoes and helmets. People in the region are also advised to discuss evacuation procedures with family members and sleep in day clothes, not in pajamas, so they can flee immediately. Furniture should also be fixed to the floor or the wall.\n\nThe designated municipalities explained the advisory on their websites and started inspecting stocks of relief goods and equipment to be used at evacuation centers.\n\nIwaki City in Fukushima urged residents to register for emergency emails, while officials in the town of Oarai in Ibaraki Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, inspected wireless communication devices.\n\nJapan's first megaquake advisory in August of last year contained a lot of scientific jargon. It worried and baffled many across the country. Some towns closed beaches and canceled annual events, disappointing many travelers during Japan's Buddhist holidays.\n\nMany people postponed planned trips and rushed to stock up on rice, dried noodles, bottled water and portable toilets, leaving shelves empty at many supermarkets in western Japan and even Tokyo, which is outside of the at-risk area."

        "content": "Trump's Gaza peace plan struggles to progress as Israel and Hamas face tough choices\n\n2 days ago Share Save Lucy Williamson Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem Share Save\n\nAnadolu via Getty Images Search and rescue groups attended a two storey building collapse following heavy rainfall in Beit Lahia on Friday\n\nA steady stream of water trickles through openings in the tent Ghadir al-Adham shares with her husband and six children in Gaza City. Her family is still displaced after the war and waiting for reconstruction to begin. \"Here we are, living a life of humiliation,\" she told the BBC. \"We want caravans. We want our homes rebuilt. We long for concrete to keep us warm. Every day I sit and cry for my children.\"\n\nTwo months into an American-imposed ceasefire, Gaza is stuck in the first phase of Donald Trump's peace plan - its territory divided between the warring parties, its people still displaced and surrounded by rubble. Heavy rain has deluged camps and led several buildings to collapse, as a powerful winter storm sweeps through the Strip. More than 800,000 Gazans are at risk from flooding, the UN says.\n\nGhadir al-Adham is longing to move her children into a solid home\n\nSticking point\n\nPlans for new homes - and new government - lie frozen in the next stage of US President Donald Trump's peace deal, as the search continues for Israel's last missing hostage, Ran Gvili. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has insisted Hamas must return all Israel's hostages – living and dead – before the two sides move on to the next, more difficult, stage of the peace deal. But several searches of Gaza's rubble have so far shown no sign of him. Mr Gvili was captured during the 7 October Hamas attacks - a police officer, recovering from a broken shoulder, who went to defend nearby kibbutz Alumim.\n\nHandout Yellow flags have been hung for Ran Gvili near his home in southern Israel\n\nHis parents, Talik and Itzik, were told last year he had not survived. The road to their home in Meitar, in southern Israel, is lined with banners paying tribute to him, the yellow flags of remembrance for Israel's hostages fluttering alongside. \"They stole our kid, they stole him,\" his mother Talik told me. \"They know where he is,\" Itzik said. \"They just try to hide or keep him. They're play[ing] with us.\" They believe Hamas wants to keep their son as an insurance policy against future negotiations, after returning all the other hostages, both living and dead.\n\nItzik Gvili (right) accuses Hamas of trying to hide his son\n\nIn response, a Hamas official told the BBC their allegations were untrue, and that Israel was trying to avoid implementing the agreement. But with no sign of Ran's body, and pressure from Washington growing, his parents say they are counting on Israel's leaders not to move forward before their son is found. \"Everyone in Israel['s] government says to us, 'No, we don't move to the second level until Ran comes back.' This is their promise,\" Talik said. Many in Israel believe it would be politically difficult for Netanyahu to carry out the next steps in the deal, including withdrawing Israeli forces further back towards Gaza's perimeter, if even one hostage is still missing in Gaza.\n\nTime 'running out'\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas face difficult concessions in the next stage of the deal. For Hamas, it means handing over weapons and power. For Israel, handing over security to an international stabilisation force. And this is also why leaders on both sides may be hesitating, says retired General Israel Ziv, a former head of Israel's military Operations Directorate. \"Israel and Hamas are sharing the same interests not to move so fast into the second stage,\" he told me. \"Hamas doesn't want to lose control, and the Israeli side for political reasons also prefer to stay in Gaza, as nobody wants to explain to their base that they have to withdraw.\" He says Trump is the only one who can force the two sides forward, and that time is running out.\n\n\"By waiting I think we might miss the opportunity because Hamas is reorganising and [its] strength is coming back,\" he explained. \"We have to take a deep breath and go forward with that plan, because staying in the situation as it is, it's the worst-case scenario.\" Disarming Hamas – in a way both sides will accept – is seen as the first major hurdle. Without that, no foreign countries are likely to commit troops to secure the Strip, and no reconstruction is likely to begin in Hamas-controlled areas. Earlier this week, Netanyahu suggested he was sceptical that foreign nations could complete the task in place of Israel. \"Our friends in America want to try to establish an international force that will do the job,\" he said. \"We know that there are certain tasks that this force can do. I don't want to go into detail, they can't do everything, and maybe they can't do the main thing, but we'll see.\"\n\nTrump eager to move fast\n\nGaza is currently divided in two by the \"yellow line\" marking the limits of Israeli forces under the first stage of the ceasefire deal.\n\nIsrael's military chief of staff recently referred to it as a \"new border line\", sparking accusations that Israel was signalling an intention to remain there long term. Key issues, including how to disarm Hamas, are due to be discussed at a meeting between Netanyahu and Trump in Florida later this month. The US president – who has already brokered a ceasefire in Gaza and pushed his peace plan through the UN Security Council – has been outspoken about his desire to move the process forward. He told journalists this week that he would announce the membership of a newly created Board of Peace for Gaza early next year. \"It will be one of the most legendary boards ever… Everybody wants to be on it,\" he said.\n\nGetty Images The floods make it hard for Gazans to keep children dry"

Here's a county-by-county breakdown of ongoing fires in the region as of Dec. 1:\n\nBay County\n\nBrandon Road Fire, 100% contained to five acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nCalhoun County\n\nShuman Ferry Road Fire, 75% contained at 10 acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nJackson County\n\nPond Lane Fire, 75% contained at 3.5 acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nAvery Road Fire, 100% contained at seven acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nWashington County\n\nRock Hill Church Road Fire, 75% contained at 6.5 acres as of Dec. 1.\n\nHolmes County\n\nHighway 179 Fire, 80% contained at six acres as of Dec. 1.\n\nOkaloosa County\n\nR40 Fire, 0% contained at five acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nSanta Rosa County\n\nHosea Gillman Road Fire, 95% contained at 1.5 acres as of Nov. 29.\n\nJimmy Ates Road Fire, 95% contained at 1.5 acres as of Nov. 29.\n\nDavis Road Fire, 0% contained at 0.75 acres as of Nov. 29.\n\nSome areas in 'exceptional drought' condition\n\nThe fires come as dry conditions have plunged the entire panhandle into drought. The worst conditions are around the state line with Georgia, where the area is within the most severe drought category: \"Exceptional Drought.\"\n\nMost of the eastern half of the panhandle and the Big Bend are a step down from the worst, sitting in \"extreme drought\" conditions, as of the Nov. 26 U.S. Drought Monitor update. Conditions aren't as bad west of Bay County, with most of Okaloosa and Walton counties in \"severe drought\" conditions.\n\nThe Pensacola area hasn't fared as badly, with parts of the metro within the \"abnormally dry\" to \"none\" categories.\n\nIn the panhandle, Bay, Washington, Calhoun, and Liberty Counties are under a burn ban. As far as fire danger at the time of publication, Dec. 1, the FFS has marked fire danger across the panhandle as \"low.\" Some beneficial, but not drought-busting, rain swept across the region over the Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nWhen will we see rain?\n\nThe National Weather Service's Tallahassee forecasting office said in a Facebook post that more rain is expected at the beginning of the week of Dec. 1, and there's a moderate chance of more rainfall toward the end of the week. Anticipated rainfall is expected to be helpful, but it won't end the drought.\n\nKeetch-Byram Drought Index values, essentially how dry the ground is, are still relatively high around the panhandle. Bay County had a KBDI of 635 on Dec. 1, indicating that it would take 6.35 inches of widespread rainfall to bring the soil back to a saturated condition. Early week showers are only expected to bring up to 1.5 inches of rainfall to Panama City, according to the NWS.\n\nStreamflows remain below normal at Econfina Creek, the Choctawhatchee River and the Chipola River, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. The seasonal forecast from the Climate Prediction Center shows drought persisting but improving for Bay and Washington counties, along with much of the Eastern panhandle and Big Bend.\n\nPossibility of severe weather Dec. 1 and 2\n\nMeanwhile, there's a marginal risk of severe weather for the night of Dec. 1 and the morning of Dec. 2.\n\n\"There is a marginal risk of severe thunderstorms late tonight through early Tuesday morning for portions of the Florida panhandle, mainly near the coast,\" wrote a NWS meteorologist in our area's forecast discussion. \"A tornado or two is possible in this area along with gusty winds.\"\n\nBehind the severe weather threat on Dec. 2, temperatures are expected to chill off for the next seven days. A low of 36 is forecasted for the evening of Dec. 2, after which lows are anticipated to stay in the 40s.\n\nMore on drought conditions: Burn ban enacted amid severe drought in Bay County\n\nIn better news, Hurricane Season is officially over, and the Gulf Coast made it out unscathed. No further tropical development is expected."

For the last four to five decades, the long-term average number of major quakes in a year has been surpassed about a dozen times.\n\nBut having two such quakes in a short period of time happens from time-to-time and doesn't necessarily signal another impending disaster.\n\n\"It's not all the time, but it's not that crazy,\" said Brandon Schmandt, professor at Rice University and seismology expert.\n\nIt's a reminder of an uncomfortable truth in earthquake science: Scientists know disastrous earthquakes are looming, but have no reliable way to predict when they will hit.\n\n\"No one can predict earthquakes. However, by investigating faults and past quakes, scientists can better assess the likelihood of future earthquakes and how intense their shaking might be,\" the USGS said.\n\nHow strange is it for two big earthquakes to hit?\n\nBy \"pure random chance,\" it's actually not uncommon for two quakes with 7.0 or higher magnitudes to hit this close together in time, according to CalTech seismologist Lucy Jones.\n\n\"We average about one magnitude-7.0 per month somewhere in the world,\" Jones said.\n\nThe average of one per month is randomly distributed, Jones said. We might go several months without one, and then see multiple within a close span. Jones said she would estimate based on probabilities that paired magnitude-7 or higher earthquakes are likely to come within half a week of each other once every few years.\n\n\"It's not like it happens all the time, but we've looked for and can't find any physical correlation,\" she said.\n\nOne earthquake can trigger another, as in an aftershock, but that's not the relationship between the Alaska and Japan quakes, which appear to be wholly unrelated, Schmandt said. Aftershocks tend to happen in the same geographic area as the main earthquake.\n\nJones said there is about a 5% chance after any earthquake that another one will follow nearby within a few days that is bigger in magnitude. Though a 5% chance might not seem like much, it's a much greater than the baseline chances, and it's what's driving Japanese authorities to stay on high alert for the time being, she said.\n\nA recent example happened in 2019 near Ridgecrest, California, Jones noted. A 6.4-magnitude hit on the Fourth of July, and less intense aftershocks followed. Then, one day later, a 7.1 quake became the largest to strike Southern California in 20 years.\n\nIs the US in danger of devastating earthquakes? What about 'the Big One?'\n\nMost of the United States is at risk for damaging earthquake shaking within the next century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which published a report last year that found hundreds of previously unidentified faults around the country.\n\nPeople in 37 states have experienced earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.0 or greater in the last two centuries, according to the USGS.\n\nThe danger is most concentrated along the West Coast and the southern part of Alaska, where the most active tectonic plate boundaries are found.\n\nConcerns of a so-called \"Big One\" event, a massive quake bringing untold devastation, have long rattled residents in these areas. It could happen at any time, or not for a long time, experts say. And there could be more than one \"Big One.\"\n\nSchmandt said the Cascadia Subduction Zone that stretches from Northern California up through Oregon and Washington and into Canada has the potential for a lurking event that could be considered \"the Big One.\" The last known quake in this fault happened in January 1700, with an estimated 9.0 magnitude, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management.\n\n\"Currently, scientists are predicting that there is about a 37% chance that a megathrust earthquake of 7.1+ magnitude in this fault zone will occur in the next 50 years. This event will be felt throughout the Pacific Northwest,\" the department said.\n\nWhat do earthquake magnitudes mean?\n\nAccording to Michigan Technological University, earthquake magnitudes can have the following effects:\n\nBelow 2.5: Generally not felt\n\nGenerally not felt 2.5 to 5.4: Minor or no damage\n\nMinor or no damage 5.5 to 6.0: Slight damage to buildings\n\nSlight damage to buildings 6.1 to 6.9: Serious damage\n\nSerious damage 7.0 to 7.9: Major earthquake. Serious damage\n\nMajor earthquake. Serious damage 8.0 or greater: Massive damage, can destroy communities\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise and Terry Collins, USA TODAY; Reuters"

        "content": "When a magnitude 8.8 earthquake ripped through the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone on July 29, 2025, it launched a Pacific-wide tsunami – and a rare natural experiment.\n\nNASA and the French space agency’s SWOT satellite happened to pass overhead. The satellite captured the first high-resolution, spaceborne swath of a great subduction-zone tsunami.\n\nInstead of a single neat crest racing across the basin, the image revealed a complicated, braided pattern of energy dispersing and scattering over hundreds of miles. These are details that traditional instruments almost never resolve.\n\nThe results go well beyond a pretty picture. They suggest the physics we use to forecast tsunami hazards – especially the assumption that the largest ocean-crossing waves travel as largely “non-dispersive” packets – need a revision.\n\nSatellites transform tsunami mapping\n\nUntil now, deep-ocean DART buoys have been our best open-ocean sentinels: exquisitely sensitive, but sparse, each giving a time series at a single point.\n\nSWOT maps a 75-mile-wide swath of sea surface height in one pass. This lets scientists see the tsunami’s geometry evolve in both space and time.\n\n“I think of SWOT data as a new pair of glasses,” said study lead author Angel Ruiz-Angulo of the University of Iceland. “Before, with DARTs we could only see the tsunami at specific points in the vastness of the ocean.”\n\n“There have been other satellites before, but they only see a thin line across a tsunami in the best-case scenario. Now, with SWOT, we can capture a swath up to about 120 kilometers (75 miles) wide, with unprecedented high-resolution data of the sea surface.”\n\nFrom eddies to a tsunami\n\nNASA and the French space agency CNES launched SWOT in December 2022 to survey surface water around the world.\n\nRuiz-Angulo and co-author Charly de Marez had been poring over its data for ocean eddies when the Kamchatka event hit.\n\n“We had been analyzing SWOT data for over two years understanding different processes in the ocean like small eddies, never imagining that we would be fortunate enough to capture a tsunami,” noted the researchers.\n\nTsunami behavior breaks rules\n\nClassic teaching holds that big, basin-spanning tsunamis behave as shallow-water waves. Their wavelength dwarfs ocean depth, so they march along without breaking into separate components.\n\nSWOT’s snapshot argues otherwise for this event. “The SWOT data for this event has challenged the idea of big tsunamis being non-dispersive,” said Ruiz-Angulo.\n\nWhen the team ran numerical models that included dispersive effects, the simulated wave field matched the satellite pattern far better than “non-dispersive” runs.\n\nThat matters because dispersion repackages the wave train’s energy as it approaches land. “The main impact that this observation has for tsunami modelers is that we are missing something in the models we used to run,” said Ruiz-Angulo.\n\n“This ‘extra’ variability could represent that the main wave could be modulated by the trailing waves as it approaches some coast. We would need to quantify this excess of dispersive energy and evaluate if it has an impact that was not considered before.”\n\nBlending every clue available\n\nSWOT’s swath told scientists what the wave looked like mid-ocean. DART buoys anchored the timing and amplitude at key points.\n\nTwo gauges didn’t line up with tsunami predictions from earlier seismic and geodetic source models – one recorded the waves earlier than expected, and the other recorded them later.\n\nUsing an inversion that assimilated the DART records, the researchers revised the rupture. It extended farther south and spanned roughly 249 miles (400 kilometers), not the 186 miles (300 kilometers) that many initial models assumed.\n\n“Ever since the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake in Japan, we realized that the tsunami data had really valuable information for constraining shallow slip,” said study co-author Diego Melgar. Folding that information in isn’t yet routine.\n\nAs Melgar argued, this is because the hydrodynamic models needed to model DARTs are very different from the seismic wave propagation ones for modeling the solid Earth data.\n\n“But, as shown here again, it is really important we mix as many types of data as possible.”\n\nOld quakes guide new warnings\n\nThe Kuril–Kamchatka margin has a history of producing ocean-wide tsunamis. A magnitude 9.0 quake in 1952 helped motivate the Pacific’s international alert system, which issued basin-scale warnings during the 2025 event.\n\nSWOT’s pass adds a new kind of evidence to that warning toolbox. With enough luck and coordination, scientists could use similar swaths to validate and improve real-time models.\n\nThis will be especially important if dispersion turns out to shape near-coast impacts more than we thought.\n\n“With some luck, maybe one day results like ours can be used to justify why these satellite observations are needed for real or near-real time forecasting,” Ruiz-Angulo said.\n\nA turning point for tsunami forecasts\n\nThree takeaways emerge. First, high-resolution satellite altimetry can see the internal structure of a tsunami in mid-ocean, not just its presence.\n\nSecond, researchers now argue that dispersion – often downplayed for great events – may shape how energy spreads into leading and trailing waves, which could alter run-up timing and the force on harbor structures.\n\nThird, combining satellite swaths, DART time series, seismic records, and geodetic deformation gives a more faithful picture of the source and its evolution along strike.\n\nFor tsunami modelers and hazard planners, the message is equal parts caution and opportunity.\n\nThe physics now has to catch up with the complexity that SWOT has revealed, and planners need forecasting systems that can merge every available data stream. The waves won’t get any simpler – but our predictions can get a lot sharper.\n\nThe study is published in the journal The Seismic Record.\n\nImage Credit: NOAA\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

        "content": "As the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season ends, the future of forecasting is AI\n\ntoggle caption Ricardo Makyn/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMIAMI — The Atlantic hurricane season, which draws to an official close on Sunday, fulfilled forecasts it would be an active year.\n\nThere were 13 named storms and three Category 5 hurricanes. But, for the first time in a decade, a hurricane did not make landfall in the U.S.\n\nThe season's most destructive hurricane, Melissa, was one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever. It slammed Jamaica with 185 mph winds, devastating communities and killing dozens of people.\n\nA week before the hurricane made landfall, however, forecast models disagreed on where it would go. One model that got it right — accurately predicting Melissa's path and its Category 5 intensity — was a new one: Google's DeepMind AI-based hurricane model.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLoading...\n\nJames Franklin, a former branch chief at the National Hurricane Center, analyzed how the forecast models performed this year and says Google's DeepMind outshone them all. \"The model performed very, very well, which was very impressive,\" he says. \"It was the best guidance we saw this year.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence has been used in weather forecast models for some time. Google's DeepMind, though, marks a significant step forward, one that suggests AI may soon overtake the physics-based models meteorologists have long relied on.\n\nModels like the Global Forecast System — the GFS — developed by NOAA, are based on equations that calculate how wind, moisture and heat move around in the atmosphere. The models utilize these equations to predict what might happen in the atmosphere, including the track and intensity of hurricanes.\n\ntoggle caption James Franklin\n\nAI models like Google's DeepMind, on the other hand, don't know anything about physics but focus instead on history. \"They have been developed to go back and look at historical records and tease out patterns and relationships about what has happened in the past in very subtle ways that a person could not extract on their own,\" Franklin says.\n\nTo develop their hurricane model, engineers at Google worked closely with scientists at the National Hurricane Center and Colorado State University's Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere. Kate Musgrave, a research scientist at CIRA, analyzes the performance of AI-based models, including the one developed by Google.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe says in the past, AI models did well with one part of a hurricane forecast — tracking the path of a storm, \"Because that is governed by large-scale influences in the atmosphere. Intensity, however, how strong a storm will be, is not captured well in the AI models.\" But the Google model did very well in forecasting intensity, she says, because it added historical data detailing how past hurricanes developed.\n\nMusgrave believes AI modeling may be the future not just for hurricanes, but also in forecasting other weather phenomena, everything from tornadoes to cold snaps.\n\nAs for hurricanes, as AI models develop, she believes meteorologists will be able to forecast tracks and intensity earlier than ever before, a vital improvement.

        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The man accused of sparking the deadly wildfire that ripped through a Los Angeles neighborhood in January must remain jailed while he awaits trial, a judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nFederal officials have said Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, started a small fire on New Year’s Day that smoldered underground before reigniting nearly a week later and roaring through coastal Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many of Los Angeles’ rich and famous. The fire, which left 12 dead in the hillside neighborhoods, was one of two blazes that broke out on Jan. 7, killing more than 30 people in all and destroying over 17,000 homes and buildings while burning for days in Los Angeles County.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Rozella A. Oliver denied his bond, saying he must be kept in custody due to his mental health and distress he caused his sister and her family. Rinderknecht’s father testified in support of his release, denying that his son had mental health issues.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRinderknecht was arrested Oct. 7 in Florida, where he staying at his sister’s house. A judge ordered that he remain jailed after a prosecutor said he had traits of an arsonist and his family had worried about his declining mental state. Prosecutors also argued Rinderknecht was a flight risk because he had family in France and spoke French.\n\nHe was brought to Los Angeles about two weeks later and pleaded not guilty in court.\n\nRinderknecht's sister offered him $10,000 to leave her house\n\nProsecutors mentioned two incidents during Rinderknecht's time in Florida when his sister and her husband called 911 because they were concerned about his behavior.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I’m afraid that when he’s triggered ... he might actually use his gun,” his father told law enforcement in body camera footage.\n\nOne time, Rinderknecht got into an argument with his sister after finding out she had cancer, telling her that she should become vegan.\n\nHe also told her he would burn her house down.\n\nLess than a week later, Rinderknecht had an argument with his father, who was visiting from France, and told him that he had purchased a gun. He said he bought it because his relationship with his sister's husband was worsening and would use if attacked.\n\nHis sister told law enforcement that he was “sensitive and volatile” and they felt like they were “walking on eggshells” around him, especially with young children in the home, Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Alexander said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt one point he told his sister, \"If I wanted to kill you guys I could’ve done that a long time ago,\" his sister said in body camera footage. She called him angry, paranoid, and delusional.\n\nRinderknecht's sister and her husband offered to pay for his move back to California and give him $10,000 if he left their home voluntarily, but he refused unless they gave him $25,000, Alexander said. His sister and her husband moved out instead.\n\n“I don't want to be in the house with my kids with him and a gun,” his sister said in body camera footage.\n\nDespite these incidents, his father said Rinderknecht's sister and her husband were willing to have him back in their Florida home, and put up $100,000 for his bond. His father said he and Rinderknecht's mom were willing to move back from France and watch over him.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe family is \"very supportive of him,” his father said. “They are ... upset that Jonathan is being accused of things he hasn't done.”\n\nRinderknecht was indicted on one charge of malicious destruction by means of a fire, one count of arson affecting property used in interstate commerce, and one count of timber set afire. If convicted, he would face up to 20 years in federal prison.\n\nHis trial is scheduled for April 21, 2026.\n\nAttorney blames fire department for not putting out initial blaze\n\nFederal officials called the Palisades blaze a “holdover fire” from the Jan. 1 fire that Rinderknecht is accused of starting, which was not fully extinguished by firefighters. LA’s interim fire chief said such fires linger in root systems and can reach depths of 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 meters), making them undetectable by thermal imaging cameras.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRinderknecht's attorney Steve Haney has said that even if Rinderknecht was the cause of the initial smaller fire on New Year’s Day, there were several “intervening factors” in the week between that day and when the Palisades Fire ignited, mainly the Los Angeles Fire Department's response to the fire.\n\nHaney said after the bond hearing that he's contemplated whether his client can get a fair trial in Southern California or whether it needs to be held elsewhere.\n\n“Jonathan is being scapegoated for governmental failures,” Haney said. “There's no way that the Palisades Fire should have ever happened. It happened because (the LAFD) didn't do their job.”\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the Los Angeles Times, firefighters mopping up the initial fire were ordered to leave the area even though they complained the ground was still smoldering and rocks remained hot to the touch. Mayor Karen Bass’ new pick for fire chief, Jaime Moore, has promised to commission an outside investigation into the matter.\n\n“We're going to get those text messages,” Haney said."

Most denied the allegations.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nInterior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said about 320,000 members of the Iglesia Ni Cristo, or Church of Christ, led the start of the three-day rally in Manila's Rizal Park, many wearing white and carrying anti-corruption placards. Hundreds, including retired generals, held a separate anti-corruption protest late Sunday at the \"People Power\" monument in suburban Quezon city.\n\nIglesia is an influential group that votes as a bloc and is courted by political candidates during elections.\n\nThe police, backed by the military, went on full alert and deployed thousands of personnel to secure the weekend rallies, although the government expects them to be peaceful, according to a confidential security assessment seen by The Associated Press.\n\nDuring a Sept. 21 anti-corruption demonstration, a few hundred black-clad protesters threw rocks, bottles and firebombs at police near the presidential palace in Manila, injuring more than 100 officers. Criminal complaints have been filed against 97 protesters.\n\ntoggle caption Mark Cristino/AP\n\nThe presidential palace went on security lockdown over the weekend, with major access roads barricaded by anti-riot police, cargo containers and barbed wires.\n\nNational police chief Lt. Gen. Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. ordered law enforcement to exercise \"maximum tolerance\" in Sunday's rallies.\n\nMarcos promises quick action as outrage over corruption grows\n\nFlood control is an especially sensitive issue in the Philippines, one of Asian countries most prone to deadly typhoons, flooding and extreme weather. Two typhoons left at least 259 dead this month, mostly from flash floods and landslides, and affected millions of others.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been trying to quell public outrage and street protests sparked by the scandal, saying on Thursday that many of the powerful senators, members of Congress and wealthy businesspeople who were implicated would be in jail by Christmas.\n\nMarcos said an independent fact-finding commission he created has already filed criminal complaints for graft and corruption and plunder against 37 suspects. Criminal complaints have also been filed against 86 construction company executives and nine government officials for allegedly evading nearly 9 billion pesos ($152 million) in taxes.\n\nAmong those accused are lawmakers opposed to and allied with Marcos, including former House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president's cousin and a key ally; and former Senate President Chiz Escudero. Both have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSen. Bong Go, a key ally of former President Rodrigo Duterte, has also been accused of involvement in corruption in flood control and other infrastructure projects. He has denied the allegations.\n\nDuterte, a harsh Marcos critic, was detained by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands in March for alleged crimes against humanity over his brutal anti-drugs crackdowns.\n\nHis daughter, the current vice president, said Marcos should also be held accountable and jailed for approving the 2025 national budget, which appropriated billions for flood control projects.\n\nThere have been isolated calls, including by some pro-Duterte supporters, for the military to withdraw support from Marcos, but Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen.

The wind reading was so high it was off the edge of the graph chart that displays the measurements.\n\n\"I knew it was a potentially historic observation,\" Hazelton told USA TODAY on Nov. 20. \"It was sobering to see it happen right near landfall.\"\n\nOther scientists watching the data flow in had similar reactions to the peak gust, a mix of awe at the power of nature and concern for the havoc it can wreak on people and their communities.\n\nAt least 90 deaths have been blamed on Hurricane Melissa, including 45 in Jamaica, where Melissa struck the island as a Category 5 hurricane on Oct. 28 with winds at the surface of more than 150 mph. Jamaican officials said this week Melissa caused at least $8.8 billion in damages. The storm also claimed lives in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n252 mph? Hurricane scientists see potential record in wind data\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration promptly contacted the atmospheric research center to ask them to confirm the measurement.\n\n\"NOAA looped us in when they saw the high wind speed and asked, 'Are these numbers any good?'\" said Holger Vömel, a senior scientist in the center's dropsonde program.\n\n\"They have pilots and researchers literally putting their lives on the line to get these measurements,\" Vömel stated in a news release. \"They’re the heroes, and it’s a privilege we get to play a role in making sure the measurements they acquire are accurate.\"\n\nThe center's staff ran the gust through a quality control program, checked that the numbers tracked with the laws of physics and typical hurricane behavior. With no gaps in reported measurements, and no other anomalies, the center confirmed the gust surpassed the previous dropsonde record gust of 248 mph, measured during Tyhpoon Megi over the Western Pacific in 2010.\n\nThe dropsondes, dropped through a chute in the hurricane hunter aircraft, gather data at levels that would be unsafe for the airplanes and their human passengers.\n\nThe crew aboard Kermit was deploying a fleet of instruments into the hurricane, where they dropped down through intense winds and rain, also streaming data on pressure, temperature and humidity back to the plane, where it could be transmitted to the hurricane center.\n\nThe 252-mph wind gust was recorded just before the dropsonde plunged into the Caribbean south of Jamaica on the morning of Oct. 28. Melissa, with peak sustained winds of 185 mph, was one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic.\n\nBut forecasters at the National Hurricane Center and the models they use \"need to know what is happening near sea level because that’s where people and property are most affected,\" said Terry Hock, an engineer who manages the dropsonde program at the foundation's atmospheric research center. \"The dropsonde gets you information you can’t get any other way and that’s why it’s been around for decades.\"\n\nThe scientists and engineers at NCAR works with other hurricane scientists to continue advancing the technology and tools to analyze the data the dropsondes collect.\n\nInto the eye of a hurricane: How NOAA uses drones penetrate monster storms\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, has written about hurricanes, tornadoes and violent weather for more than 30 years.

In her debut novel Tilt, voted one of Scientific American’s best fiction books of 2025, Pattee explores this hypothetical day through the eyes of Annie, a Portland local who is nine months pregnant and shopping for cribs at IKEA when disaster strikes. Through the novel, Annie goes on an epic journey to get home and in doing so makes some profound discoveries.\n\nScientific American spoke with Pattee about what the inspiration for her book was and why it was so important for her to get the science right.\n\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Why did you decide to focus on this location?\n\nI came to this idea, like so many writers, because I live in Portland and I’m a climate journalist. I was at IKEA, and the idea came to me; I knew that I wanted to write something hyperrealistic, not realizing how hard of a challenge it would be to write a “nonfiction fiction” book about something that hasn’t happened yet.\n\nAs a science journalist, what science messages do you hope readers will take away from this book?\n\nJust to be clear, this is not a work of climate fiction, though certainly it is an allegory of climate fiction. I think what I hope people will take from the book is that the “big” earthquake is not a scenario where everyone is going to die. And in Portland around the time I was writing, that’s how a lot of people talked about this hypothetical earthquake, saying things like, “What’s the point of prepping—because everyone’s just going to die.” Very few people were speaking in a grounded way. Something that came from writing this book is the understanding that not that many people are going to die in the earthquake, but you are going to deeply want water, and the people around you are going to need water, and you’re going to feel like such a bad human that you didn’t get water for the vulnerable and sick people around you.\n\nWhy did you decide to explore this hypothetical earthquake through fiction?\n\nI think a lot of really great nonfiction has already been written about this earthquake. There’s a book called Full-Rip 9.0 by Sandi Doughton. It’s fantastic. There’s the Pulitzer Prize–winning article in the New Yorker by Kathryn Schulz about earthquake risk in the Pacific Northwest; there’s not much I could add to that. What interested me the most is that you can write so much about science, but people still struggle to take it home, to see how it’s going to impact their lives. I started to feel like a lot of the work I was doing around climate change was just writing for other scientists. There’s really not a lot written that would just tell a regular person living in Portland what they might need to expect, emotionally or otherwise.\n\nThe story does a good job of not sensationalizing or invoking too much fear in the reader, but it also illustrates that a mega earthquake would be very bad. It almost sounds like a kind of preparedness exercise for you. Is that accurate?\n\nI don’t think it was a preparedness prompt mainly because, without spoiling the ending, she’s not prepared! I’m not prepared for the earthquake. How do we live under the shadow of something that’s coming that everyone says we should get prepared for, but there’s actually no way to prepare for it? That’s climate change, and that’s an earthquake that’s going to destroy our city. But that’s also parenthood and having a child. I think that was more what I was writing about than, like, how could someone life-hack the earthquake, which I still don’t know.\n\nThis book is disturbingly mundane in parts; I think your opening scene is the perfect example of this. Why did you start off with Annie shopping in IKEA?\n\nI’m sure a lot of that is about my work as a climate journalist. I would talk to these scientists, and then we would turn off the recorder and have these incredibly painful conversations; then I would have to grab my kid from school and go food shopping. I’m somehow holding this idea that we potentially are looking at extinction, and I still have to go get yelled at by a daycare teacher because I brought the wrong size diapers. I am very interested in that aspect of modern life right now. In the beginning Annie is so shaped by consumerism, and the earthquake literally shakes her free of that. At the end, she maybe comes back to her more authentic, beastly form. That’s terrifying, but in some ways, is that also beautiful?\n\nHow did you keep track of Annie through time and space so closely?\n\nI extensively used Google Maps and mapped her route. I wrote a lot of this book on the streets where it happened. I wrote a lot of this book in IKEA. I spent so much time in these physical spaces, really trying to describe things as accurately as possible. I went to an earthquake drill at a brick school [building]. I went to an emergency training day with our neighborhood emergency teams here, and I had first-person interviews with people who were on site after major earthquakes in China [in 2008] and in [the autonomous region Azad Kashmir in Pakistan in 2005]. I even rode a bike while 40 weeks pregnant because people kept saying they didn’t think the bike scene was believable. I worked with a graduate student—basically we came up with the magnitude of earthquake and picked the date the earthquake was going to happen. We came up with how much rainfall there had been so we could come up with soil conditions. That level of accuracy almost became a North Star for me. I do think it’s a really hard way to write fiction, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody.\n\nOne feature of the novel that stood out was your use of flashbacks. Were you just giving the reader a breath, or is there something else that you were trying to explore?\n\nYeah, I mean, 9/11 was the primary source material that I used for this book. I really leaned so heavily on 9/11 accounts. I read a lot of accounts about people [who needed] to take long walks to get home and along the way came to really big decisions about their lives. And that was so interesting to me. Why does Annie need to change her life? And why does this change feel sort of impossible without the earthquake? I think for her it’s also about the sort of internal inventory of her life. I’ve met people who have experienced this suspended moment in time where their priorities became really, really clear, and you have a chance to change your life. For me, that is the central message of the book: there’s still time to change your life.\n\nOne of the most harrowing scenes involves Annie finding some parents who are looking for their lost children in a collapsed school building. How did you keep that scene so touching as a human and also scientifically accurate?\n\nThe school scene was very complicated for me because there are almost two dozen schools here in Portland at risk of collapse in a large earthquake. As I was writing the book, I really learned how this is a profound moral dilemma to send children to school in buildings like that. I felt such a moral weight about writing a scene like that; it was so important to me that it was very accurate. I brought in actual rescue experts to read that and tell me if it was realistic. I am a parent of young children in Portland. A lot of my friends have kids who go to those schools. It was really important that I wasn’t going to make it worse than it would be and I wasn’t going to make it better than it would be. In a sort of a strange twist of fate, the local paper here ran that scene the week my book was published next to a reported article that I wrote. There was just an enormous amount of uproar from it that pushed the school board to commit to fixing 10 of the most dangerous brick buildings, which was something that parents had been working on for more than a decade.\n\nHow did writing this book change your perspective on earthquakes, humanity and life in general?\n\nWhen I started writing it, I thought a big earthquake meant people would be breaking into my home to take my food and water. I have had such a profound shift. Part of that is becoming a parent and being much more connected to my community. I really started to see that my goal in preparing for the earthquake is not so that I have food and water for myself and my kids but that I have enough to share with the most vulnerable people on my street. Preparedness, for me, has become more of a civic duty—shifting from this feeling of fear to thinking it might actually be an opportunity where I could help other people fills me with so much meaning.\n\nCan you tell me what other books on this subject—or that you used in your research or maybe that you’ve read recently—you could recommend?\n\nFor my research I read The Dog Stars by Peter Heller. I read a book called Wave by Sonali Deraniyagala, who lost her children in the tsunami in the Indian Ocean. It is a very, very intense read. I’m reading a book called Confidence by Rafael Frumkin, and it’s fantastic. Another book that really had a big impact on me was Weather by Jenny Offill, a fictional book about climate change."

        "content": "Hurricane Melissa was already one of the most powerful hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean—and now scientists have confirmed a new way it neared superlative status.\n\nNewly released data show that Hurricane Melissa produced a wind gust of 252 miles per hour—just 1 mph shy of the fastest wind gust ever measured on Earth, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and 4 mph faster than the most powerful gust ever measured in a tropical cyclone at sea.\n\nThe previous record-holding storm, 2010’s Typhoon Megi, was located in the Pacific Ocean, where warmer waters typically permit the most powerful tropical cyclones to grow a little stronger than those in the Atlantic Ocean. “It’s actually quite amazing to see a sounding that breaks that record,” says Holger Vömel, an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who worked with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologists to verify the measurement was not the result of an instrument error.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n[Sign up for Today in Science, a free daily newsletter]\n\nLISTEN: Hurricane Melissa Was One of the Strongest Atlantic Storms Ever. Here’s Why\n\nHolger Vömel/NSF NCAR\n\nThere’s an important distinction between these powerful gusts—transient bursts of wind—and the sustained winds that dictate a storm’s ranking on the Saffir-Simpson scale. This system of five categories is based on the strongest wind that lasts for one minute. Gusts do not need to persist and therefore can clock at much higher speeds than sustained winds can.\n\nHurricane Melissa’s sustained wind speeds reached a remarkable 185 mph, just 5 mph short of the Atlantic Ocean record. It achieved this monstrous strength because of its slow journey over abundant warm ocean waters.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nScientists measure wind speeds and other vital data from the top of the storm to the Earth’s surface with an instrument called a dropsonde, which was released from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft.\n\nVömel has helped examine previous potential record-breaking measurements. “I have a full understanding of all the gory details of how these measurements are taken,” he says. “I can look at it and see if there’s anything suspicious.” In one notable case, he helped show that an apparently record-breaking measurement from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was just an artifact of a malfunctioning instrument. But the observations from Hurricane Melissa checked out. “Everything behaved exactly as it was intended to,” he says.\n\nThe observation wasn’t quite high enough to shatter the current record for the fastest wind ever measured on Earth: 253 mph achieved by a 1996 tropical cyclone that hit Barrow Island in Australia. But Vömel says that’s not a fair comparison. The 1996 storm’s record was measured at 10 meters (33 feet) above the ground. The one from Hurricane Melissa was made 20 times higher up and over the ocean. Natural and artificial topography on land can channel wind in ways that speed it up—which is not the case inside a hurricane.*\n\nBesides these newly confirmed data, Hurricane Melissa was nearly record-setting in other ways: The storm reached a minimum central pressure of 892 millibars—making it tied for the third strongest hurricane on record in the Atlantic. And its sustained wind speeds tied it for second place in the Atlantic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHurricane Melissa also broke records in its devastation: it was the strongest storm to ever make landfall in Jamaica, and it caused the second-highest recorded rainfall in the nation since 2000.\n\n“These storms must be taken seriously,” Vömel says. “This is a record-breaking sounding, and it’s really amazing that we can observe that. But there’s also people on the ground who suffered through that.”\n\n*Editor’s Note (11/21/25): This paragraph was edited after posting to correct the height at which the 1996 storm’s record was measured."

        "content": "Intense flooding has significantly reduced rice harvests around the world in recent decades, putting at risk the food supply of billions of people who rely on the grain as a dietary staple. Between 1980 and 2015, annual losses averaged about 4.3%, or roughly 18 million tons of rice each year, according to Stanford University research published November 14 in Science Advances.\n\nThe researchers found that the damage has grown worse since 2000 as extreme floods have become more common in many of the planet's main rice-growing regions. They report that climate change is likely to further increase the frequency and severity of these destructive floods in the coming decades.\n\nDroughts, Floods, and a Delicate Balance for Rice\n\nScientists and farmers have long known that rice yields fall during droughts. The new study adds fresh detail to this picture, estimating that droughts reduced rice yields by an average of 8.1% per year during the 35-year study window. At the same time, the work draws attention to a related but less examined danger from too much water. Rice plants benefit from shallow standing water during early growth, yet prolonged or deep flooding can severely damage or kill the crop.\n\n\"While the scientific community has focused on damage to rice yield due to droughts, the impacts of floods have not received enough attention,\" said Steven Gorelick, the study's senior co-author and a professor of Earth system science in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. \"Our research documents not only areas where rice yields have suffered due to past flooding, but also where we can anticipate and prepare for this threat in the future.\"\n\nWhat Counts as a 'Rice-Killing' Flood\n\nThe research team clearly spells out, for the first time, the conditions that turn a flood into a lethal event for rice, said lead study author Zhi Li, who worked on the project as a postdoctoral fellow in Gorelick's lab at Stanford and recently joined the faculty of the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nThey found that a full week of complete submergence during the plant's growth cycle is the critical tipping point. \"When crops are fully submerged for at least seven days, most rice plants die,\" Li said. \"By defining 'rice-killing floods,' we were able to quantify for the first time how these specific floods are consistently destroying one of the most important staple foods for more than half of the global population.\"\n\nHow the Researchers Measured Flood and Drought Damage\n\nTo estimate how much past droughts and floods have harmed rice production, the scientists combined several lines of evidence. They drew on information about rice growth stages, annual global rice yields, a worldwide database of droughts and floods dating back to 1950, a model of how floods behave across landscapes, and a simulation of soil moisture levels over time in major rice-growing river basins.\n\nTheir analysis indicates that, in the coming decades, the most intense week of rainfall in key rice-growing basins around the world could deliver 13% more rain than the average for those regions during the 1980 to 2015 baseline period. This projected increase suggests that rice-killing flood conditions may become more common as the climate continues to warm.\n\nFlood-Resistant Rice Varieties and High-Risk Regions\n\nWider use of flood-resistant rice varieties could help reduce future losses, especially in the areas that face the highest risk. The study highlights the Sabarmati Basin in India, which experiences the longest rice-killing floods, along with North Korea, Indonesia, China, the Philippines, and Nepal, where the impact of such floods on rice yields has grown the most in recent decades. The greatest total losses have occurred in North Korea, East China, and India's West Bengal.\n\nThe researchers also identified exceptions, such as India's Pennar Basin, where flooding appears to boost rice yields. They suggest that in these locations, hot and dry conditions may allow standing floodwater to evaporate quickly, reducing long-term damage and sometimes even creating favorable moisture conditions for the crop.\n\nCompounding Climate Stresses on Rice\n\nFor Gorelick and Li, the new findings reinforce the need to understand how rice responds not only to floods and droughts, but also to heat waves and cold stress, both individually and when they occur in succession. Earlier research has shown that rapid swings from drought to flood and back again can nearly double rice yield losses compared with single flood or drought events on their own. According to the authors, \"How these combined effects can be mitigated remains a major challenge.\"\n\nAdditional co-authors not mentioned above include Lorenzo Rosa, who is affiliated with the Department of Earth System Science in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science. The research was supported by a Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship awarded to Li by the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability."

        "content": "Scientists reveal what triggered Santorini 'earthquake swarm'\n\n21 November 2025 Share Save Victoria Gill Science correspondent Share Save\n\ngetty\n\nThe \"swarm\" of tens of thousands of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini earlier this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered. They used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust. They used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them. One of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions.\n\nWhat happened in Santorini?\n\nThe seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt. Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt - or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956. The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm. The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor. The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something. \"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"\n\nDoes this mean the Santorini unrest is over?"
