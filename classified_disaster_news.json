Triggered by a rare cyclone in November, the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. \"Does the central government not know [what we're experiencing]? I don't understand,\" a tearful Ismail A Jalil said in front of cameras. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is \"under control\". \"Indonesia is capable of overcoming this disaster,\" he told his cabinet last week. Prabowo has also ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts.\n\nPrabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he won in February 2024 on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over mass food poisonings. In August and September, thousands of Indonesians took to the streets over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Many in Aceh still do not have ready access to clean water, food and electricity\n\nDesperate calls for help\n\nLast Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: \"I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world.\" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. \"The flags do not mean we are giving in. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,\" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, told the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. Survivors have spoken of sickness and starvation. \"How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,\" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring that he welcomes help \"from anyone, anywhere\". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a \"national scale\", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts.\n\nDisaster strikes again\n\nFor some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. Aceh, already ravaged by decades of civil war, was among the hardest-hit. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects. \"Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added. Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods - but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government.\n\nGetty Images Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch"

        "content": "Since 2020, scientists have installed monitoring instruments around the Barry Landslide in Alaska's Prince William Sound to closely track seismic activity in the area. Their goal is to detect warning signs early, before a sudden landslide could trigger a destructive tsunami.\n\nBy analyzing these seismic recordings, researchers identified a previously unrecognized type of signal. These events are marked by sharp, high-frequency pulses that become more common from late summer through mid-winter, then suddenly stop in late winter or early spring.\n\nStrange Signals Linked to Freezing and Thawing Rock\n\nWriting in Seismological Research Letters, Gabrielle Davy of the University of Alaska Fairbanks and her colleagues propose that the signals are caused by water freezing and thawing inside tiny cracks in the rock beneath the nearby Cascade Glacier. The research team is the first to carry out a systematic analysis of these short, impulsive seismic events near the Barry Landslide.\n\nThe scientists emphasize that these signals are not signs that the landslide itself is moving. However, they may still provide valuable insight into changes in underground water conditions behind the slope. Those changes could eventually play a role in triggering slope movement.\n\nWhy the Barry Landslide Poses a Serious Risk\n\nSearching for seismic warning signs at Barry Arm is especially important because the landslide sits in a highly unstable setting. The slope is steep and underlain by weak, heavily fractured bedrock, making it prone to failure. It has also lost critical support from Barry Glacier, which has rapidly melted and retreated over the last century.\n\n\"What makes Barry Landslide especially concerning is the size of the landslide,\" Davy explained. \"It's a large, slowly moving mass -- on the order of about 500 million cubic meters -- that has been creeping for decades.\"\n\n\"If a rapid collapse were to occur, the material would fall directly into the fjord, and that could generate a tsunami with potentially high wave heights,\" she added. \"Barry Arm is visited by kayakers and cruise ships, and nearby communities such as Whittier could be affected, so understanding the hazard is important from both a scientific and a public-safety perspective.\"\n\nSorting Through a Year of Seismic Data\n\nBecause of these risks, the landslide area has been extensively instrumented since 2020. The study by Davy and her colleagues is among the first to carefully examine the large volume of seismic data collected by those instruments.\n\nFor this research, the team manually reviewed an entire year of continuous seismic waveform recordings. They searched for signals that might help determine when and where a landslide could occur.\n\nThis hands-on approach allowed the researchers to recognize the wide range of signals present in the data. These included vibrations from small earthquakes, glacier motion, slope deformation, and other sources of seismic background noise.\n\n\"We needed to build a clear baseline understanding of the types of signals that routinely occur in the area, so that any unusual or previously unrecognized signals would stand out. By spending time with the raw data, you train your eye to recognize what 'normal' looks like\" before developing classification tools and detection algorithms, Davy explained.\n\nSeasonal Patterns Reveal a Freeze-Thaw Process\n\nAfter learning how to identify the unusual short-impulsive events in the seismic records, the researchers compared them with weather and rainfall data. They also used ground-based radar to track subtle changes in slope movement. This combination allowed them to study when and where the signals occurred.\n\nThe timing, location, and characteristics of the signals pointed to small, brittle events that happen seasonally as water freezes and thaws inside cracks in the rock.\n\n\"Similar seismic signals have been documented in other settings, although they are not widely reported,\" Davy said. She pointed to a recent study from Norway that observed comparable signals near an unstable rock slope and \"suggested that their signals may be linked to freeze-thaw processes acting on cracks within the bedrock.\"\n\nToward Better Landslide Early Warning Systems\n\nCo-author Ezgi Karasözen said the Alaska Earthquake Center is now testing a regional landslide detection system at the Barry Landslide site. According to Karasözen, the system \"will alert us to any slope failures in this area.\"\n\n\"As research on landslide seismology grows, there's increasing recognition that precursor seismic activity -- when it does occur -- can be an important source of early warning,\" Karasözen said. \"That motivates broader investigations not only at Barry Arm, but also at other sites in southern Alaska where similar hazards exist.\""

        "content": "Since Donald Trump regained the U.S. presidency, he has talked about taking over Greenland. He has insisted that the U.S. will control the island, currently an autonomous territory of Denmark, and that if his overtures are rejected he will perhaps seize Greenland by force. That idea was back in the news again in early 2026 and drawing international condemnation.\n\nWhen Congress held a hearing on Greenland’s importance to the U.S. in 2025, senators and expert witnesses had focused on the island’s strategic value and its natural resources: critical minerals, fossil fuels and hydropower. No one mentioned the hazards, many of them exacerbated by human-induced climate change, that those longing to possess and develop the island will inevitably encounter.\n\nThat’s imprudent, because the Arctic’s climate is changing more rapidly than anywhere on Earth. Such rapid warming further increases the already substantial economic and personal risk for those living, working and extracting resources on Greenland, and for the rest of the planet.\n\nI am a geoscientist who studies the environmental history of Greenland and its ice sheet, including natural hazards and climate change. That knowledge is essential for understanding the risks that military and extractive efforts face on Greenland today and in the future.\n\nGreenland: Land of extremes\n\nGreenland is unlike where most people live. The climate is frigid. For much of the year, sea ice clings to the coast, making it inaccessible.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAn ice sheet, up to 2 miles thick, covers more than 80% of the island. The population, about 56,000 people, lives along the island’s steep, rocky coastline.\n\nWhile researching my book “When the Ice is Gone,” I discovered how Greenland’s harsh climate and vast wilderness stymied past colonial endeavors. During World War II, dozens of U.S. military pilots, disoriented by thick fog and running out of fuel, crashed onto the ice sheet. An iceberg from Greenland sunk the Titanic in 1912, and 46 years later, another sunk a Danish vessel specifically designed to fend off ice, killing all 95 aboard.\n\nNow amplified by climate change, natural hazards make resource extraction and military endeavors in Greenland uncertain, expensive and potentially deadly.\n\nRock on the move\n\nGreenland’s coastal landscape is prone to rockslides. The hazard arises because the coast is where people live and where rock isn’t hidden under the ice sheet. In some places, that rock contains critical minerals, such as gold, as well as other rare metals used for technology, including for circuit boards and electrical vehicle batteries.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe unstable slopes reflect how the ice sheet eroded the deep fjords when it was larger. Now that the ice has melted, nothing buttresses the near-vertical valley walls, and so, they collapse.\n\nIn 2017, a northwestern Greenland mountainside fell 3,000 feet into the deep waters of the fjord below. Moments later, the wave that rockfall generated (a tsunami) washed over the nearby villages of Nuugaatsiaq and Illorsuit. The water, laden with icebergs and sea ice, ripped homes from their foundations as people and sled dogs ran for their lives. By the time it was over, four people were dead and both villages lay in ruin.\n\nSteep fjord walls around the island are littered with the scars of past rockslides. The evidence shows that at one point in the last 10,000 years, one of those slides dropped rock sufficient to fill 3.2 million Olympic swimming pools into the water below. In 2023, another rockslide triggered a tsunami that sloshed back and forth for nine days in a Greenland fjord.\n\nThere’s no network of paved roads across Greenland. The only feasible way to move heavy equipment, minerals and fossil fuels would be by sea. Docks, mines and buildings within tens of feet of sea level would be vulnerable to rockslide-induced tsunamis.\n\nMelting ice will be deadly and expensive\n\nHuman-induced global warming, driven by fossil fuel combustion, speeds the melting of Greenland’s ice. That melting is threatening the island’s infrastructure and the lifestyles of native people, who over millennia have adapted their transportation and food systems to the presence of snow and ice. Record floods, fed by warmth-induced melting of the ice sheet, have recently swept away bridges that stood for half a century.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs the climate warms, permafrost – frozen rock and soil – which underlies the island, thaws. This destabilizes the landscape, weakening steep slopes and damaging critical infrastructure.\n\nPermafrost melt is already threatening the U.S. military base on Greenland. As the ice melts and the ground settles under runways, cracks and craters form – a hazard for airplanes. Buildings tilt as their foundations settle into the softening soil, including critical radar installations that have scanned the skies for missiles and bombers since the 1950s.\n\nGreenland’s icebergs can threaten oil rigs. As the warming climate speeds the flow of Greenland’s glaciers, they calve more icebergs in the ocean. The problem is worse close to Greenland, but some icebergs drift toward Canada, endangering oil rigs there. Ships stand guard, ready to tow threatening icebergs away.\n\nGreenland’s government banned drilling for fossil fuels in 2021 out of concern for the environment. Yet, Trump and his allies remain eager to see exploration resume off the island, despite exceptionally high costs, less than stellar results from initial drilling, and the ever-present risk of icebergs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs Greenland’s ice melts and water flows into the ocean, sea level changes, but in ways that might not be intuitive. Away from the island, sea level is rising about an inch each six years. But close to the ice sheet, it’s the land that’s rising. Gradually freed of the weight of its ice, the rock beneath Greenland, long depressed by the massive ice sheet, rebounds. That rise is rapid – more than 6 feet per century. Soon, many harbors in Greenland may become too shallow for ship traffic.\n\nStreams of meltwater flow over the silt-covered surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet as it melts in summer heat near Kangerlussuaq in western Greenland. REDA/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nGreenland’s challenging past and future\n\nHistory clearly shows that many past military and colonial endeavors failed in Greenland because they showed little consideration of the island’s harsh climate and dynamic ice sheet.\n\nChanging climate drove Norse settlers out of Greenland 700 years ago. Explorers trying to cross the ice sheet lost their lives to the cold. American bases built inside the ice sheet, such as Camp Century, were quickly crushed as the encasing snow deformed.\n\nIn the past, the American focus in Greenland was on short-term gains with little regard for the future. Abandoned U.S. military bases from World War II, scattered around the island and in need of cleanup, are one example. Forced relocation of Greenlandic Inuit communities during the Cold War is another. I believe that Trump’s demands today for American control of the island to exploit its resources are similarly shortsighted.\n\nPiles of rusting fuel drums sit at an abandoned U.S. base from World War II in Ikateq, in eastern Greenland.

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Shasta counties as the rare and dangerous flood threat descended on Southern California, which was devastated by fires just a year ago.\n\nMore than 43 million Americans across California, southern Nevada and northwest Arizona are under flood watches on Wednesday amid a rare, high risk for excessive rainfall and flooding.\n\nLife-threatening flood threat. ABC News\n\nThis includes major metros like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, California, San Diego and Las Vegas.\n\nLos Angeles station KABC reported Wednesday the Inland Empire area east of LA had borne the brunt of the first wave of the storm .\n\nHeavy debris flows from heavy rainfall earlier prompted mandatory evacuations in Wrightwood, California, with the main mountain highway -- Highway 2 -- being impassable, according to the San Bernardino County Fire Department.\n\nThursday afternoon, the Los Angeles Fire Department announced that the evacuation warning for parts of the city of Los Angeles had been extended until further notice due to possible debris flows.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, the LAFD said crews were rescuing people trapped in vehicles, conducting door-to-door checks in affected areas and advising residents in danger zones to evacuate immediately.\n\nWith more rain on the way, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department on Wednesday evening issued additional evacuation orders for some areas north of the Wrightwood area.\n\nAt least one person died in an \"apparent weather-related crash,\" amid heavy rain in Sacramento County, according to the California Highway Patrol.\n\nThe Lancaster Sheriff’s Station reported on Wednesday night that it was \"responding to multiple vehicles trapped in flooded roadways due to severe storm conditions.\" It added, \"If you do not need to be on the road, please stay home until conditions improve.\"\n\nAlso Sunday, the Santa Barbara Airport, located about an hour up the coast from Los Angeles, announced it was grounding all commercial flights due to \"flooding on the airfield.\" The announcement came just hours after after the airport had reopened after closing early Thursday morning due to flooding.\n\nA series of atmospheric rivers brought high-intensity rainfall and strong winds, increasing the risk of flooding, landslides and rapidly rising creeks and rivers.\n\n\"California is acting early and decisively to do all we can to get ahead of dangerous winter storms. The state has pre-positioned resources, activated emergency authorities, and we are working closely with local partners to protect communities and keep Californians safe,\" Newsom said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nHeavy debris flows in San Bernardino County as Highway 2 floods, Dec. 24, 2025 in Wrightwood, Calif. San Bernardino County Fire/X\n\nA \"High Risk for excessive rainfall\" is in place for Los Angeles, including I-10 from San Bernardino to Santa Monica and areas north like Highway 101 to Thousand Oaks, I-5 to Burbank, Santa Clarita, and up to Pyramid Lake and all of I-210. Travel on these roads is not recommended as they may become flooded, officials said. Low-lying neighborhoods in these areas could also become flooded, forecasts show.\n\nBeing under a \"High Risk\" designation is rare. This risk is only issued about 4% of days, accounting for one-third of all flood-related fatalities and 80% of all flood-related damages, according to the NWS.\n\nPotential flooding impacts include the threat of significant and widespread urban roadway flooding, a high risk of major rock/mudslides, and rapid rises in creeks, streams and rivers which will likely lead to swift water rescues.\n\nThe recent burn scars will be at risk of possibly damaging debris flows. These flooding impacts will likely lead to significant travel delays and road closures during the busy holiday travel period.\n\nRain and snow potential. ABC News\n\nWinds are forecast to gust 40 to 50 mph across the area, potentially leading to power outages on Wednesday, according to forecasts. Thunderstorms are also possible.\n\nMore than 100,000 customers have been reported without power in California.\n\nThe heaviest rain is expected on Wednesday morning and afternoon. Rainfall rates of 1 inch per hour or greater are expected.\n\nThunderstorms will remain possible, so people will need to watch for cloud-to-ground lightning.\n\nA brief tornado cannot be ruled out today all along all of the California coast, so people should heed any tornado warnings issued.\n\nBy 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. PT, the rain will be coming to a brief end before more rain arrives overnight.\n\nAdditional rounds of rain are expected on Thursday and Friday, and the flood threat along with mudslides and landslide risks will continue each day as well.\n\nABC News' Amanda Morris contributed to this report."

        "content": "A satellite designed to measure the height of the ocean surface was in the right place at the right time when a powerful earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula sent a tsunami across the Pacific in late July.\n\nThe spacecraft, known as the Surface Water Ocean Topography or SWOT satellite, recorded the first high resolution space-based track of a major subduction zone tsunami, according to researchers writing in The Seismic Record.\n\nInstead of a simple wave moving cleanly across the ocean, the satellite data revealed a surprisingly intricate pattern of waves spreading, interacting, and scattering across the basin. Scientists say this detailed view could improve understanding of how tsunamis travel and how they may ultimately affect coastlines.\n\nCombining satellite data with ocean sensors\n\nTo better understand the event, Angel Ruiz-Angulo of the University of Iceland and his colleagues combined the satellite observations with measurements from DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) buoys located along the tsunami's path. These deep-ocean sensors helped them refine estimates of the earthquake that triggered the waves.\n\nThe July 29 earthquake struck in the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone with a magnitude of 8.8, making it the sixth largest earthquake recorded worldwide since 1900.\n\n\"I think of SWOT data as a new pair of glasses,\" said Ruiz-Angulo. \"Before, with DARTs we could only see the tsunami at specific points in the vastness of the ocean. There have been other satellites before, but they only see a thin line across a tsunami in the best-case scenario. Now, with SWOT, we can capture a swath up to about 120 kilometers wide, with unprecedented high-resolution data of the sea surface.\"\n\nA satellite built for water, not disasters\n\nSWOT was launched in December 2022 as a joint mission between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. Its main goal is to deliver the first global survey of Earth's surface water, including oceans, rivers, and lakes.\n\nRuiz-Angulo said he and co-author Charly de Marez had spent more than two years studying SWOT data to understand everyday ocean features such as small eddies. \"[We] had been analyzing SWOT data for over two years understanding different processes in the ocean like small eddies, never imagining that we would be fortunate enough to capture a tsunami.\"\n\nRethinking how giant tsunamis behave\n\nBecause the wavelength of large tsunamis is much longer than the depth of the ocean, scientists have traditionally described them as \"non-dispersive.\" In simple terms, this means the wave is expected to travel as a single, stable form rather than breaking into multiple waves that spread out over time.\n\n\"The SWOT data for this event has challenged the idea of big tsunamis being non-dispersive,\" Ruiz-Angulo explains.\n\nWhen the team compared the satellite observations with computer simulations, they found that tsunami models that included dispersion matched the real-world data more closely than traditional models.\n\n\"The main impact that this observation has for tsunami modelers is that we are missing something in the models we used to run,\" Ruiz-Angulo added. \"This 'extra' variability could represent that the main wave could be modulated by the trailing waves as it approaches some coast. We would need to quantify this excess of dispersive energy and evaluate if it has an impact that was not considered before.\"\n\nA longer earthquake rupture than expected\n\nThe researchers also noticed a mismatch between tsunami arrival times predicted by earlier models and the actual measurements recorded by two DART tide gauges. One gauge recorded the tsunami earlier than expected, while the other detected it later.\n\nUsing the buoy data in a technique known as inversion, the team reexamined the source of the tsunami. Their analysis suggested the earthquake rupture extended farther south than previously thought and stretched about 400 kilometers -- significantly longer than the 300 kilometers estimated by other models.\n\n\"Ever since the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake in Japan, we realized that the tsunami data had really valuable information for constraining shallow slip,\" said study co-author Diego Melgar.\n\nWhy mixing data matters\n\nSince that 2011 disaster, Melgar's research group and others have worked to better integrate DART buoy data into earthquake and tsunami analyses. However, this approach is still not routine.\n\nSince then, Melgar's lab and others have been working on ways to include DART data in inversions, \"but it is still not always done because the hydrodynamic models needed to model DARTs are very different than the seismic wave propagation ones for modeling the solid Earth data. But, as shown here again, it is really important we mix as many types of data as possible,\" Melgar said.\n\nImproving future tsunami warnings\n\nThe Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone has produced some of the largest tsunamis on record, including a devastating event in 1952 triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake. That disaster led to the creation of the international tsunami warning system that later issued alerts across the Pacific during the 2025 event.\n\n\"With some luck, maybe one day results like ours can be used to justify why these satellite observations are needed for real or near-real time forecasting,\" Ruiz-Angulo said."

        "content": "What does climate change look like? This year's hurricane season is one example\n\ntoggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nThe 2025 hurricane season was a study in contrasts.\n\nIn one way, it felt very quiet in the United States. No storms made landfall in the U.S. for the first time since 2015. And, for about three weeks in the middle of the hurricane season, no storms formed at all in the Atlantic.\n\nAnd yet, the storms that did form were among the most powerful hurricanes ever recorded.\n\n\"The one word I would pick for it is 'unusual',\" says Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. In 2025, the total number of tropical storms and hurricanes, 13, was about average. But a lot of those storms ended up being massive Category 5 behemoths.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We had three Category five hurricanes this year, which is the second most in a single season behind only the super hyperactive 2005 season,\" says Lindsey Long, a meteorologist with the Climate Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The infamous 2005 Atlantic hurricane season included hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. The fact that none of this year's storms made landfall in the U.S. was just luck, Long says.\n\nYears like this one, with an average number of overall storms, but an above-average cohort of very powerful hurricanes, are getting more likely because of climate change.\n\nThat's mainly because global warming is causing ocean temperatures to rise dramatically. Planet-warming pollution — most of which comes from burning oil, gas and coal — traps huge amounts of extra heat in the atmosphere. Most of that extra heat is absorbed by the oceans.\n\nThe part of the Atlantic ocean where hurricanes form has experienced record-breaking heat over the last few years.\n\n\"That water is kind of fuel for hurricanes,\" Long says. \"It helps dictate how intense the storm will be.\"\n\nThat's what happened this year with Hurricane Melissa . The storm moved over abnormally warm water as it gained strength, ultimately making landfall in Jamaica as a devastating Category 5 hurricane in late October. The Atlantic hurricane season extends from June 1 to Nov. 30.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt the same time, wind patterns can break storms apart. Wind shear, which happens when there's a big difference in wind speed high in the atmosphere versus down lower, makes it difficult for storms to form. Long says there was quite a bit of wind shear this year, which kept the total number of storms average.\n\nClimate computer models suggest that there will be more wind shear in the part of the Atlantic where hurricanes form as the Earth continues to warm.\n\nTaken together, that means a hotter planet will likely mean fewer total hurricanes, but higher percentage will be large, powerful storms .\n\nThe 2025 season \"happens to fit that mold extremely well,\" McNoldy says.\n\nNot every hurricane season will look like this. Even though the climate is steadily warming, and ocean temperatures are consistently above-average in the Atlantic, there's still a lot of variability in how many storms form and how powerful they get in any given year."

Kittitas County is about 71 miles east of King County, which includes Seattle.\n\nPaul Markoff, 38, of North Bend, and Erik Henne, 43, of Snoqualmie Pass, were killed in the incident, the sheriff's office said. The survivors, identified as Ian Laing and Patrick Leslie, were able to send a distress call using a Garmin satellite device, a portable communicator for areas with limited or no cell service.\n\nSheriff's deputies, along with the Kittitas County Search and Rescue volunteers, responded and reached the remote area using snowmobiles and winter backcountry equipment, according to the sheriff's office. The two survivors were rescued that evening.\n\n\"Due to hazardous conditions, a nighttime recovery operation for the deceased was not conducted,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 10, teams returned with three trained avalanche search police dogs but later had to request air support due to the rugged and remote terrain, according to the sheriff's office. A helicopter from King County airlifted the two deceased men to a search base, and the ground team was able to recover the four men's personal belongings, including two snowmobiles.\n\nCause of avalanche not immediately known\n\nRepresentatives from the Northwest Avalanche Center also responded to the scene to assist in analyzing the incident, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nIt was not immediately known what caused the avalanche, but the Northwest Avalanche Center had reported that the four backcountry tourers were caught and carried in the avalanche in the \"upper Teanaway River drainage of the East Central zone.\"\n\n\"One tourer was not buried, one was partially buried and injured, one was fully buried and killed, and one was fully buried and is presumed dead,\" the Northwest Avalanche Center said in a statement on Jan. 10. \"Our hearts go out to the family, friends, and community of those involved in this accident.\"\n\nBefore the incident, heavy mountain snow had been impacting Washington state through the week, according to the National Weather Service's field office in Seattle. On Jan. 8, the weather service reported that 34 inches of snow were recorded on Mount Baker, 25 inches of snow at Stevens Pass, and 27 inches at Snoqualmie Pass.\n\nOn Jan. 10, the weather service warned that high snow levels and additional rain were expected across the region into the week, especially in the Olympic and northern Cascade Mountains. Flooding was also forecast along the Skokomish River.\n\nLatest avalanche fatality in the United States\n\nEach winter, 25 to 30 people die in avalanches in the United States, according to the National Avalanche Center. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center has noted that the majority of incidents involve backcountry skiers, snowboarders, and snowmobilers.\n\nAs of Jan. 11, five people have been killed across the country by avalanches for the 2025 to 2026 winter season, according to data from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. For the 2024 to 2025 winter season, a total of 22 people were killed in avalanches.\n\nSeveral incidents have made national headlines over the last year, including two separate avalanches in Oregon and California in February 2025 that killed three skiers. In March 2025, another skier was found dead after being caught in an avalanche in Utah's Uinta mountains, and three heli-skiers and a teenager were killed in separate avalanches in Alaska.\n\nIn December 2025, a ski patroller was killed in an avalanche at Mammoth Mountain resort in central California while conducting avalanche mitigation work. Earlier this month, a snowmobiler was killed in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range after an avalanche buried him in snow."

And at least 2 million people are facing blizzard warnings in the Midwest. Power outages were mounting as the storm moved east, with more than 300,000 customers nationwide without electricity by Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.com.\n\nHazardous conditions could persist into Wednesday, particularly around the Great Lakes and interior New England, as lake-effect snow and gusty winds continue behind the main system, according to the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. Some meteorologists are also watching whether the system rapidly intensifies as it tracks across the Great Lakes, a process sometimes referred to as “bombogenesis.”\n\nHeavy snow falls along Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis on Dec. 28. (Jerry Holt/Star Tribune via AP) (AP)\n\nMidwest and Great Lakes: Blizzard conditions and widespread disruptions\n\nThe storm is delivering some of its most dangerous impacts across the Upper Midwest and the Great Lakes, with heavy snow, powerful winds and near-whiteout conditions reported in several areas.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nForecasters say snowfall could exceed a foot in portions of the upper Great Lakes, with up to 2 feet possible across the south shore of Lake Superior. Wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph could further reduce visibility and create dangerous whiteout conditions in parts of the Upper Midwest, particularly in areas experiencing heavy or blowing snow, including portions of Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.\n\nThe powerful system is also expected to generate near-record swells on Lake Superior, with waves potentially reaching as high as 34 feet.\n\nSome areas of Michigan have already reported a foot of snow, with Minneapolis seeing between 5 and 7 inches as the storm continues to intensify.\n\nStay safe on the roads, Minnesota.\n\n\n\nSlow down, give @MnDOT snowplows room to work, and check https://t.co/hBN241ZjcH for the latest road conditions. — Governor Tim Walz (@GovTimWalz) December 28, 2025\n\nNortheast and mid-Atlantic: Ice, freezing rain and travel risks\n\nAs the storm pushes east, forecasters warn that ice and freezing rain could pose the greatest danger across interior New England and parts of the Northeast, where a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain is expected before warmer air changes precipitation to rain. Even modest ice accumulation could make roads treacherous and increase the risk of downed trees and power outages.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe National Weather Service said ice accumulations could reach up to seven-tenths of an inch in parts of northern New York and Vermont by Monday evening. Already, in Connecticut, more than 1,600 power outages were reported Monday as freezing rain and fog coated roads and downed equipment.\n\nIn New York, officials reported widespread outages upstate, with tens of thousands of customers without power Monday morning. Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office warned that strong winds combined with snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour could lead to “potential whiteout conditions” in some areas.\n\nTravel in the Buffalo area could become dangerous starting at 11am due to potential whiteout conditions. It is critical everyone stay off the roads and stay safe. https://t.co/uTIGcGt1Pl — Governor Kathy Hochul (@GovKathyHochul) December 29, 2025\n\nForecasters said the most dangerous icing conditions are expected through Monday evening before temperatures gradually rise and precipitation turns to rain in many areas.\n\nFlights: Cancellations and delays mount nationwide\n\nThe storm is also snarling air travel. As of mid-Monday morning, FlightAware reported at least 945 flight cancellations nationwide and more than 16,500 delays, including over 550 cancellations and at least 2,430 delays within, into or out of the United States.\n\nDelta Air Lines accounted for the largest share of disruptions, with roughly 3% of its scheduled flights canceled by midmorning. Most of those cancellations were tied to weather impacts in the Midwest and the Great Lakes, where snow, high winds and reduced visibility forced airlines to cut service. Major hubs including Chicago's O’Hare, Minneapolis–St. Paul and Detroit each reported dozens of cancellations as conditions worsened."

Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days. The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at \"catastrophic\" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed. One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most \"significant\" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires.\n\nOn Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported. Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C. In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days. Friday will be the \"real peak of the current burst of heat,\" Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC. \"It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania\". Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said. \"Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow,\" Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria. \"This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020,\" Hines said. That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and tens of millions of hectares of land was burnt."

Still, it became a classic for its wistful, melancholy melody and poetic lyrics. Stevie Nicks wrote the song as she contemplated her future with or without Lindsey Buckingham. Sure, she was looking at the Rocky Mountains, but a landslide was simply a metaphor. Nicks ultimately ended their romantic relationship but continued to work with Buckingham, which proved to be the right choice.\n\n\n\nBut what if the song were about a real landslide, an avalanche, a natural disaster? Dustin Ballard, also known as There I Ruined It (previously at Neatorama) collaborated with guest songwriters Griefcat to make it so. Now the subject matter is completely at odds with the laid-back tune, but they match the title at least. And now we have a There I Ruined It song you can share with your mother."

        "content": "Ace Aguirre was just two bites into his oatmeal on the morning of November 4 when he noticed something strange: mud had seeped onto the living room floor of his bungalow in Cotcot, a village in the Philippines’ Cebu province.\n\nThe moments that followed will be forever seared into Aguirre’s memory. His living room furniture floating; the terrifying few minutes when he wasn’t sure he’d be able to pry the front door open; his son praying to God as the water rose to their chests; his daughter, who can’t swim, perched high on a pillar as water and cars gushed by, inches from her feet.\n\n“I don’t know how we were able to survive. One detail that didn’t go our way and many of us could have died,” Aguirre told CNN.\n\nThat morning Typhoon Kalmaegi dumped over a month’s worth of rain, causing rivers and waterways in Cebu to swell and unleashing catastrophic flash flooding that killed more than 230 people nationwide.\n\nOne of the dead was Aguirre’s neighbor, a mother of two, who drowned when she became trapped in her kitchen. He had tried to save her but couldn’t get her out in time.\n\nTorrential downpours and deadly flooding in the tropical, disaster-prone Philippines are not new. But revelations in recent months that politicians, officials and contractors had looted billions of dollars from the nationwide program supposed to mitigate their effects have roiled the country.\n\nAguirre's daughter faces rising floodwaters on November 4 in her village of Cotcot, Liloan, in the Philippines' Cebu province. Virnalyn Catipay\n\nPrior to the deadly flooding, a citizens’ group in Cebu had called for an audit of flood control projects along the Cotcot River, upstream from where Aguirre lives, according to local media.\n\nThe scandal has embroiled dozens of high-ranking lawmakers and officials who allegedly received kickbacks to award contracts. Those revelations have sparked huge youth-led anti-government protests against corruption and wealthy elites, similar to those seen this year in Indonesia and Nepal.\n\nAguirre had been watching the political drama unfold far away in Manila, the capital, for months, but he didn’t expect it to come to his doorstep.\n\n“All of a sudden you become a direct victim,” he said. “It hits different.”\n\nThe flooding in November prompted Cebu’s governor Pamela Baricuatro to demand an investigation into the 26 billion pesos ($443 million) in flood-control projects in the province which officials in Manila admitted “should have been working” by the time disaster struck.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. later visited the region and promised to clear and clean the waterways, and de-clog drainage systems, in time for rainy season next year.\n\nThe previous July he had revealed a government flood control program worth more than 545 billion pesos ($9.2 billion) had been plagued by corruption.\n\nHe said an internal audit found many of the 10,000 projects his government had overseen since he came to power in 2022 had been built using substandard materials or not at all, he said, referring to the projects as “ghost projects.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Philippine government for comment.\n\nWhen Marcos Jr exposed the fraud, he “opened a can of worms” that has since spun out of his control, said Sol Iglesias, associate professor of Political Science at the University of the Philippines.\n\nThis aerial photo shows damaged houses in the aftermath of Typhoon Kalmaegi in Talisay, in Cebu province on November 5, 2025. Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTestimonies in the House and Senate have revealed “an entire system of plunder and corruption that has been facilitated by the very agencies that were responsible for budgeting, planning, implementing, monitoring and checking on the financial soundness of these infrastructures,” Iglesias said.\n\nIn September, Finance Secretary Raph Recto told a Senate hearing up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2 billion) in funding for flood control may have been lost to corruption in the past two years, according to the Associated Press news agency.\n\nMarcos Jr has vowed to jail at least 37 congressmen and other officials responsible for the scams by Christmas, and seven have been thrown behind bars so far. The government has also frozen about 12 billion pesos ($204 million) in assets of individuals linked to the scandal.\n\nThe scandal has galvanized ordinary Filipinos, who have taken to the streets to protest decades of unchecked corruption.\n\n“This is the last straw for the Filipino people,” said Tiffany Faith Brillante, the head of Youth Rage Against Corruption in the Philippines, which has been involved in the protests.\n\nFilipino activists protest near the presidential palace on Human Rights Day in Manila, Philippines on December 10, 2025. Eloisa Lopez/Reuters\n\n“The corruption today is no longer just a symptom of weak governance,” she said. “It’s deeply rooted in how power is held in the government, how budgets are allocated, and how accountability is constantly avoided.”\n\nMarcos Jr has insisted he did not know of the fraud being perpetrated. He has positioned himself as a corruption crusader, shaming those responsible for the graft and egging on the protesters.\n\nBut as more top-ranking officials have become implicated in the scandal, some have pointed the finger back at the president.\n\nOne of those people is Zaldy Co, a one-time Marcos Jr ally and former House appropriations committee chairperson, who has become one of the central figures accused in the scandal. He fled the country and is currently a fugitive.\n\nWhile in hiding, he posted a series of explosive videos to his social media account, accusing Marcos Jr and his family members of profiting from the corruption – charges which the president has denied.\n\nMarcos’s family members have also been caught up in the drama. Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, a cousin of Marcos, resigned as House Speaker in September over the controversy, though he has denied any involvement in the scandal.\n\nBeyond the scale of the alleged theft, what has made this scandal hit so hard is that for many Filipinos it feels like history is repeating itself, said Aries Arugay, a Filipino political scientist and visiting senior fellow at the Singapore-based think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\n“Corruption and the Marcoses are almost synonyms in Philippine politics,” Arugay said.\n\nMarcos Jr’s father, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, ruled the Philippines with an iron fist from 1965 until his ouster in 1986, with the country living under martial law for about half that time. His regime committed systemic human rights abuses and engaged in widespread corruption, stealing an estimated $10 billion from public coffers.\n\nThe flood control scandal has reminded Filipinos of the dark days many experienced under Marcos Sr. One of the biggest anti-corruption protests was held on a significant date, September 21, when in 1972 Marcos Sr imposed martial law.\n\nMarcos Jr’s landslide victory in 2022 marked an extraordinary comeback for the notorious political family, which critics claimed was made possible in part by disinformation campaigns which whitewashed the history of the Marcos era.\n\nAnd though officials have warned the looting of the flood prevention program may have started under Marcos’ predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, the disparity between the lifestyles of the elite and regular Filipinos has been a source of anger under the current president.\n\nPhilippines' President Ferdinand Marcos Jr speaks during a press conference at Malacanang Palace in Manila on November 13, 2025. Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSocial media videos posted by the children of wealthy politicians and contractors flaunting their lavish lifestyles have added salt to the wounds of angry citizens, Arugay said.\n\n“When people are being submerged in flood water, the politicians are in Paris, riding their private jets,” he said.\n\nThis backlash against so-called “nepo kids” mirrors similar anti-corruption protests across Asia this year, including in Indonesia and Nepal, where Gen-Z led protests overthrew the government.\n\nLike those protests, young people have been some of the loudest voices calling for accountability in the Philippines.\n\n“We inherit the consequences of corruption and systemic abuse in our country if the government continues to steal, oppress and ignore the people,” Brillante said.\n\n“We really want to hold accountable and jail every single official involved in corruption,” Brillante said.\n\n“President Marcos cannot be spared, because at the end of the day, he’s the one who signs and approves the national budget every single year.”\n\nWhile public confidence in Marcos Jr has wavered, he’s not likely to meet the same fate as his father, who was unseated in a public uprising.\n\nMarcos Jr is more than halfway through his six-year term, and Philippine presidents have single term limits, so he will not be eligible for re-election in 2028.\n\n“We haven’t seen the equivalent of a smoking gun,” Iglesias said.\n\n“But if (we get) that smoking gun, for example, evidence of his directly benefitting financially from this corruption, then that will I think push the administration over the edge. Right now, it’s teetering.”\n\nFilipinos march alongside an effigy depicting Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr during a protest against corruption in Manila, Philippines on November 30, 2025. Lisa Marie David/Getty Images\n\nRecent public opinion polling by the firm WR Numero found Marcos Jr’s satisfaction rating was 21% in November, a 14% drop from August.\n\nFor someone who came so close to losing everything, Aguirre is upbeat and grateful. But he’s not optimistic that this wave of public momentum will produce any meaningful change in the Philippines.\n\n“With our resilience, we can still move forward, but the quality of life will still be the same.”"

The Minnesota State Patrol said the highway also was blocked in the southern part of that state,\n\nU.S 18 was closed indefinitely east of Clear Lake with what the O'Brien County sheriff reported on Facebook were accidents in both directions. The Iowa State Patrol said that across the state as of Sunday evening, it had investigated 31 crashes, one fatal and eight with injuries. It provided no details..\n\nIn addition to the 30 Iowa counties for which the weather service issued a blizzard warning, another county remains under a winter storm warning and a winter weather advisory is in effect south to the Interstate 80 and 29 corridors. The area includes the Des Moines and Ames metros, where a fast-developing snow squall brought a burst of snow that prompted the weather service to issue a warning of possible whiteout conditions.\n\nThe squall moved across the state, hitting Newton, Marshalltown, Grinnell and Waterloo before dissipating. Another snow squall hit Monona, Harrison and Shelby counties in western Iowa.\n\nThe blizzard warning is in effect through 9 a.m. Monday. It covers Blackhawk, Bremer, Butler, Calhoun, Cerro Gordo, Chickasaw, Clay, Dickinson, Emmet, Fayette, Floyd, Franklin, Grundy, Hamilton, Hancock, Hardin, Howard, Humboldt, Kossuth, Mitchell, O'Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Pocahontas, Sac, Webster, Winnebago, Winneshiek, Worth and Wright counties.\n\nThe winter storm warning, covering Allamakee County in extreme northeast Iowa, also has been extended to 9 a.m. The winter weather advisory for other Iowa counties is slated to expire at 6 a.m. in central Iowa south of Interstate 80. It will continue until 9 a.m. north of I-80, including Ames, and in the eastern part of the advisory area, including Iowa City.\n\nThe weather service said the counties in the blizzard warning area could expect 2 to 7 inches of snow with extremely high and gusting northwest winds, creating potential whiteout conditions. Estherville Municipal Airport reported a gust of 62 mph.\n\nThe winter storm warning covers an area extending into Wisconsin that could see 5 to 7 inches of snow by the time the storm ends. It also was experiencing high winds.\n\nRain preceded the snow in some areas, including central Iowa, and posed the potential for especially hazardous driving conditions as temperatures across the state quickly fell.

More than half the month's total snowfall happened in the last five days of the month, when 49 inches of snow fell.\n\nRecord-setting snowfall was part of an extreme winter weather pattern that contributed to the sinking of several large vessels in Juneau's harbor. Residents in surrounding communities are bracing for possible avalanches.\n\nThe Coastal Alaska Avalanche Center reported at least three avalanches during the last week of December in the state capital. All three avalanches occurred at elevations of 1,900 to 2,450 feet. Five more avalanches were observed during the first five days of 2026.

He extricated himself with bruises on his face and arms by crawling in darkness in the rubble and debris.\n\n“I saw a light and crawled toward it in a hurry, because I feared there will be more landslides,” Antigua said. “It was traumatic. I feared that it was my end, so this is my second life.”\n\nIt is unclear how the accident would affect garbage disposal in the landfill in Cebu, a bustling port city of nearly a million people that serves as a regional hub for trade, commerce and tourism.\n\nPreparations “are also underway to manage the looming garbage collection issue,\" Archival said in his statement without further details.\n\nSuch landfills and open dumpsites have long been a source of safety and health concerns throughout the Philippines, especially in areas close to poor communities where many residents scavenge for junk and leftover food in the garbage heaps.\n\nIn July 2000, a huge garbage mound in a shantytown in suburban Quezon City, part of metropolitan Manila, collapsed and ignited a fire after days of stormy weather.\n\nThe disaster left more than 200 people dead and many more missing, damaged scores of shanties and prompted a law requiring the closure of illegal dump sites nationwide, as well as improved and more sustainable waste management by authorities."

Annabelle Chih/Getty Images\n\nTaiwan needs to focus on having the right weapons to deter and, if necessary, fight China in an full-scale war, a former top Taiwanese defense official said. Annabelle Chih/Getty Images\n\nTo prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nChina's grey-zone activities include regular military drills that practice blockades and invasions of Taiwan. GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan has ramped up military exercises focused on island defenses, including a large one earlier this year. Anadolu/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome."
