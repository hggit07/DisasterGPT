        "content": "Dozens dead in 'total devastation' left behind by Hurricane Melissa\n\n30 October 2025 Share Save Share Save\n\nGabriela Pomeroy and Nardine Saad\n\nHurricane Melissa floods and destroys towns across Caribbean including in Cuba, Jamaica and Haiti (pictured)\n\nHurricane Melissa has continued its devastating sweep across the Caribbean, destroying homes and infrastructure, flooding neighbourhoods and leaving dozens dead. The impact in Jamaica was clearer on Wednesday, after the island nation was hit squarely by the category five storm - one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the region. At least five people have been confirmed dead there. At least another 20 died during flooding in Haiti as Melissa, now a category two storm, tore through the region. In Jamaica, people remain stranded on roofs and without power. Prime Minister Andrew Holness noted the \"total devastation\" across the island-nation.\n\nHe added that \"80-90% of roofs were destroyed\", along with hospitals, libraries, police stations, port houses and other urban infrastructure. King Charles, who is the head of state in Jamaica, said in a statement that he was \"deeply concerned\" and \"profoundly saddened\" at the damage caused by Melissa in Jamaica and across the Caribbean. \"This most dreadful of record-breaking storms reminds us of the increasingly urgent need to restore the balance and harmony of Nature for the sake of all those whose lives and livelihoods may have been shattered by this heartbreaking disaster,\" he said.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Hurricane Melissa caused flooding and damage to buildings in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba\n\nFrom Jamaica, where the storm also caused mudslides, and palm trees to be tossed like toothpicks, Melissa moved north to Cuba as a category three storm, bringing 115 mph winds and heavy rain, and battering the south-east of the island. How do hurricanes form and are they getting stronger?\n\nWhat makes Melissa such a dangerous storm?\n\n'We are all terrified', say locals in path of Hurricane Melissa Rovier Mesa Rodríguez, a video maker who lives in Santiago de Cuba, called the storm \"terrifying\" and described it sounding \"like a tornado\". Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel asked residents to \"not let their guard down\" and said that the country had prepared for a worst-case scenario, which helped its response. On Wednesday night, the storm was 105 miles (170km) from the central Bahamas and expected to reach the Bahamas region overnight. Hurricane Melissa was moving north-east with wind speeds at 100 mph (155 km/h). A dangerous storm surge is expected there before it moves further north toward Bermuda. A tropical storm warning is in place for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the speed of the slow-moving hurricane is expected to increase in the coming days.\n\nHurricane Melissa - what we know about the damage in Jamaica\n\nIn Jamaica, three men and a woman were confirmed dead. They were discovered after being washed up by the flood waters in the storm, said Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica's minister of Local Government and Community Development. About three-quarters of the country lost electricity overnight. Richard Vernon, mayor of Montego Bay, told the BBC that half of the city had been cut off from the other by floods. He said the priority was to \"check if everybody is alive\". A resident in St Elizabeth sheltering in her four-bedroom home described the moment her roof blew off. Gordon Swaby, a businessman in Kingston, told the BBC that his first cousin's house was completely destroyed. His cousin - who he declined to be named - recently moved from the United States to her \"dream\" house by the sea in the upscale Crane Road area. She lost the entire concrete structure and everything in it. \"She wanted a different kind of life,\" Gordon said. \"She chose the area because she loves the sea, so this is really devastating.\" Devastation was evident on Wednesday across central Jamaica. The city of Mandeville was flattened and the main road through town was littered with debris. Foliage was stuck to everything, and bits of building material were scattered along the road. The clean-up is expected to take months. Pia Chevallier, who is on holiday in Jamaica, said she felt \"sick with worry\" during the storm overnight. \"The windows didn't stop vibrating.\"\n\nWatch: Strong winds and flying debris as Hurricane Melissa makes landfall in Jamaica"

        "content": "Before and after: Satellite images reveal hurricane devastation in Jamaica\n\n30 October 2025 Share Save Nick Beake , BBC Verify USA Correspondent and Thomas Copeland , BBC Verify Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nWith power down, problems with communications and navigating parts of the island treacherous, the authorities in Jamaica have not yet been able to give a detailed assessment of the damage inflicted by Hurricane Melissa. But the devastating impact of the Category 5 storm on communities is starting to be revealed by satellite imagery. BBC Verify has been examining the new images to try to piece together what has been destroyed and what has been left standing.\n\nBlack River\n\nArguably the most striking impact can be seen in images of the southwestern coastal port of Black River. We can identify specific buildings that have been battered or in some cases destroyed. By comparing a satellite image taken on 9 February with one taken on 29 October - after the hurricane hit - you can see that the distinctive white roof of a building housing a market has been replaced by a gaping hole. A little further north, a café has been wiped off the map. At the top of the image, the red roof of a warehouse has disappeared. The outline of the fire station next to the market is still visible but the top of the building appears to have been torn off. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has described Black River as \"ground zero\" after sharing footage of the destruction there.\n\nWhite House\n\nPhotographs of White House, a fishing village on the west coast of Jamaica which is home to several thousand people, reveal how it bore the brunt as Melissa made landfall with winds of up to 185 mph.\n\nNearly every structure appears to have been damaged or destroyed. In particular, the buildings next to the beach appear to have razed to the ground. These include restaurants called Marva's and Pelican Lookout. The top of a large circular structure is now missing and further inland, along the main road, a cluster of shops has been hit hard. Fishing boats in the bay - seen in satellite imagery on 7 October - have disappeared.\n\nMontego Bay"

At least 51 people were killed and approximately 400,000 displaced.\n\nWith communities still reeling from the natural disaster, the last thing the people of Punjab are doing is acting like a victim, says Jaskaran Sandhu, an Indo-Canadian civil lawyer who is also on the board of the World Sikh Organization (WSO), the predominant religion of the northwestern Indian state.\n\n“The destruction and the death toll was significantly mitigated by grassroots forces,” he tells Yahoo Canada from his law office in Calgary. “There has also been humanitarian aid and support from the diaspora in Canada and around the world.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile critics have slammed the Indian government for slow — or lack thereof — responses to the disaster, Canadian Sikhs have helped raise millions to help rebuild amid the historic flood across Punjab province.\n\nIndian army personnel rescue flood-affected residents and their dog on a boat across the engorged Beas river at Baoopur village in Kapurthala district in India's Punjab state on August 30, 2025.

(Photo by Shammi MEHRA / AFP) (Photo by SHAMMI MEHRA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nLawyer and community journalist: 'Floods should radicalize Punjab'\n\nSandhu, also a community journalist and co-founder of Baaz News, a media outlet covering issues of the Sikh and Punjabi diaspora, wrote an article, entitled “The Floods Should Radicalize Punjab: Punjab cannot keep sacrificing itself for an ungrateful country,” in which he called out Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s lack of response to the crisis for weeks.\n\n“It was left to Sikh institutions, Gurdwaras (Sikh temples), and ordinary Punjabis to mobilize,” he wrote. “Once again, we have been forced to save ourselves while the world’s so-called largest democracy look[ed] away.”\n\nDespite a lack of initiative from the government, Punjab did not succumb to a victimhood mentality, he continued. “There has been no looting, no violence, no collapse of social trust … This is a high-trust society in action.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat irked many Punjabis — in Punjab and around the world — was how Modi was quick to post about the earthquakes in Afghanistan to his social media channels at the beginning of September. The sentiment for a foreign country’s natural disaster woes before his own sparked many to call out his apparent lack of care and concern for Punjab.\n\n“What about Punjab? Punjab is flooded. Not a single word for Punjab. People are losing lives, houses, fields, livestock,” responded one X user.\n\nPunjabis' perception is that 'government is distant and uncaring about them as a people'\n\nBut why was the response so slow for a crisis in the state of his own country?\n\n“Modi and the BJP government [Bharat Janata Party — the country’s Hindu nationalist political party] are not the type to stay silent on things,” Sandhu says. “As Punjab is battered by the worst flood in decades — and which have brought about an unprecedented level of damage — it lends itself to the very real perception by Punjabis that the central government is distant and uncaring about them as a people.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPunjab has a long history of feeling like a second-class state in its own country.\n\nThe region feels like it ranks last for a number of reasons: Being a national minority is one of them.\n\n“It’s one of only four states that doesn’t have a Hindu majority,” Sandhu says. “Punjab also has a history of voting against the BJP, so there’s no incentive for the central government to care about us.”\n\nBut when the need is reversed, like when there is a conflict between India and Pakistan, Punjab, as a border state to Pakistan, has to suffer decisions it has no control over. Many Punjabis feel that it makes no sense to continue to sacrifice themselves for an ungrateful government.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis disillusionment with Delhi, India’s capital, has often incited separatist notions. For this reason, “India treats Punjab like an existential threat that needs to be constantly stamped out.”\n\nThere is also distrust in the state government. “Bhagwant Mann has been inept at addressing and working on resolving the destruction that has taken place since the floods,” Sandhu says, referring to Punjab’s chief minister (equivalent to a Canadian province's premier).\n\n“Their drive right now is to ask for donations for state coffers so that they can provide humanitarian support and rebuilding efforts. But the community’s response has been, ‘We’re already going through grassroots organizations and have been mobilizing ourselves and getting donations directly through Sikh aid organizations and temples, so why would we need to wait on you?’ The criticism is that the state government hasn’t really done anything to advocate for Punjab.”\n\nFrom bad to worse: 'Central government has played a big role in the floods'\n\nOf course, it could be because the state government is beholden to the Modi government. But there is also a bigger picture issue at play as to why the PM was particularly silent about the floods, at least in the beginning, Sandhu believes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“The central government has played a big role in the floods,” he says. The nature in which Punjab’s dams and canals are being managed is a major problem. “Heavy rainfall is one thing, but the way in which the water has been released out of the dam was optimized for the maximum amount of damage. The water was released in a way that made it very difficult — impossible even — to manage the outflow.”\n\nSandhu says to make matters worse, the canal that feeds Punjab’s waters to neighbouring states like Rajasthan, were shut as well. “So those floodwaters didn’t have anywhere to escape; it just pooled in Punjab. The frustration for Punjab is ‘You’ve built these canals where you extract water, depleting Punjab’s water tables and the riparian rights, and you refuse to negotiate and work with Punjab on the main sticking point.” That point involves water rights in Punjab and drier states like Rajasthan trying to extract water with the help of the central government.\n\n“But when there’s a flood and we need to mitigate floodwaters, everyone shuts those canals down. In good times you’re extracting water, and in bad times you’re shutting those canals down so that there’s no outflow.”\n\nSandhu thinks that’s the bigger problem here. “The central government has mismanaged the water release of the dams and they’ve mismanaged canal operations. This is a natural disaster that the government has an immense role in manufacturing — whether by incompetence or a lack of care.” Modi and the BJP are unable to address that legitimate critique in any meaningful way, he continues. “So they have chosen silence.”\n\nAid from government nowhere near enough\n\nOn Sept. 9, the prime minister did a flyover of Punjab to conduct an aerial survey to assess the damage. He also visited the city of Gurdaspur to interact with flood victims. The central government also announced 1,600 Crore in financial aid, but critics say it’s nowhere near enough to compensate for damages and rebuild.\n\nThe central government has mismanaged the water release of the dams and they’ve mismanaged canal operations.\n\nThe immediate, most pressing concern for Punjabis continues to be solving the problems at hand, says Sandhu. “It’s repairing infrastructure that is water-bogged; it’s fixing tractors and getting equipment so that farmers can tend to the fields again. It’s also removing sand silt that got washed onto agricultural land, making it difficult to cultivate. And of course, it’s getting homes livable again.”\n\nSikhs in Canada respond: 'The real story is a community story'\n\nThe reaction from Sikhs in Canada as well as around the world has been to immediately raise funds and support everyone back home. “Sikhs in Canada are very well-connected to Punjab: We all have family and friends and sometimes even land back home,” Sandhu says. “Punjabi-Canadian radio stations have raised millions for example, as have Gurdwaras [Sikh temples].”\n\nSikhs in Canada are very well-connected to Punjab: We all have family and friends and sometimes even land back home.\n\nREDFM, Canada’s largest South Asian media network with radio stations in Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary, ran a live on-air radiothon this past September to help raise funds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“It started early in the morning and went well into the evening — about 12 hours of continuous broadcasting,” says program director Pooja Sekhon. “Throughout the day, we had hosts sharing stories, and volunteers were taking live calls from people making donations. It was emotional, energetic, and really moving to see the momentum building as the day went on.”\n\nThe result: $2.2 million were raised as a coordinated effort across the three cities.\n\n“Each city brought its own energy, its own set of callers, and local businesses who got involved,” Sekhon adds. The funds have been directed to SAF International, a registered Canadian charitable organization that works closely with partner organizations in Punjab.\n\n“Together, they’ll be collaborating on rebuilding efforts in the affected communities.”\n\nSandhu believes that what we have witnessed in the aftermath of the Punjab floods is a deep reflection of how much Punjabis do right as a community.\n\n“The real story is a community story.”"

        "content": "The Pacific Northwest is being taken for a ride, and a major earthquake off the coast of Oregon this week was the latest jolt reminding residents just how fragile the region’s future really is.\n\nThe 4.2 magnitude quake struck nearly 200 miles from the coastal town of Barview. It was the third such seismic event in the area in the last two weeks, part of a swarm that scientists say could signal an upcoming eruption of Axial Seamount, an underwater shield volcano that last erupted in 2015.\n\n\"There's still a chance it could erupt by the end of the year. We don't really know exactly when it will happen, but nothing seems imminent since the number of earthquakes per day is relatively low,\" Bill Chadwick a researcher at Oregon State University, told the Daily Mail.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut the quake swarm is only the surface-level warning. The real threat comes from the much larger system grinding beneath the region: The Cascadia Subduction Zone—a 700-mile fault that runs all the way from California to British Columbia—where two giant tectonic plates are locked in a high-stakes standoff. The North American plate is slowly crushing the Juan de Fuca plate beneath it, according to experts, lifting the region millimeter by millimeter over centuries. But that pressure won’t build forever.\n\nWhen the plates finally slip, they’ll unleash what scientists call a megathrust earthquake, or “the great quake” in layman's terms. This magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake will be capable of violently shaking the region for minutes and triggering a massive tsunami.\n\nBut there’s another, less visible threat that could have longer-lasting consequences: subsidence, or the sinking of land. In a matter of minutes, entire coastal communities could drop by up to 6 feet, permanently redrawing the floodplain and placing thousands of homes and lives at risk.\n\nNew research shows subsidence following the great quake could double, or even triple, the number of people and properties exposed to catastrophic flooding—an impact that most flood maps and insurance models still fail to capture.\n\nWhat is subsidence (and why it matters more than you think)?\n\nMake your hands into fists and press them hard against each other. Now, tilt one fist upward, like it’s riding over the other. When the pressure becomes too much, one fist suddenly slips past the other and, in an instant, drops.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNow, imagine your fists are the Earth’s crust. That drop is called subsidence.\n\n“During one of these over magnitude 8, probably up to magnitude 9 earthquakes, the land actually deforms and drops down up to 6 feet or 2 meters,” explains Tina Dura, a coastal geologist and lead researcher on a new study examining flood exposure in the Pacific Northwest recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“Basically causing sea level rise of 6 feet within minutes.”\n\nThis instant ground-level drop doesn’t just mean higher tides. It redefines the baseline for future flooding. Areas that were once safely above water could suddenly become permanent flood zones, or even become permanently under water—changing the region’s coastline, increasing insurance costs, and putting thousands of homes at risk.\n\nWhat happens to coastal communities when the ground drops\n\nThe last time a megathrust earthquake rocked the Pacific Northwest was centuries ago, long before cities, suburbs, and infrastructure blanketed the region’s coast. But scientists like Dura are looking to the geologic record to understand what the quake left behind, and what could happen when the next one strikes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Cascadia has repeatedly dropped down up to 6 feet in these earthquakes,” she explains. “We find these marsh soils that are overlain by really clean gray tidal mud, showing that these wetlands dropped down and were converted to tidal flats repeatedly.”\n\nIn other words, when the ground sank, the ocean rushed in, flooding areas that were once comfortably above water.\n\n“On the coastal records, we can look back about 7,000 years or so, and [we’re] seeing these catastrophic changes in these estuaries,” she adds. “I'm constantly thinking about the land level change that's going to occur.”\n\n\n\nThat land level change is what makes subsidence so dangerous. What was once safe, dry ground could become a flood-prone tidal flat in a matter of minutes. And while the region once held quiet wetlands, it’s now home to entire communities.\n\nThe risks go far beyond flooded basements. Entire systems critical to public safety and daily life could be thrown into crisis. Wastewater treatment plants, electric substations, and roads built at elevations sensitive to sea level rise could be compromised.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen the coastline drops, so does everything built on it, putting lives, homes, and infrastructure directly in harm’s way.\n\nA doubling, and eventually tripling, of exposure\n\nUntil recently, most models focused on immediate impacts: shaking, waves, and storm surges. But Dura’s new research reveals what happens when you factor in subsidence—and the results are startling.\n\nIf a megathrust earthquake were to happen today, the 100-year floodplain—the key metric used to determine which homes are at risk of flood, and what homes need to purchase flood insurance policies—expands by 115 square miles.\n\n“That doubles the exposure of resident structures and roads,” Dura explains.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn other words, half of the residents who would need flood insurance to cover damage caused by flooding following a megathrust earthquake are unlikely to know that they are at risk right now. And that’s just the start.\n\nBy 2100, due to the combined effects of sea-level rise from global warming, the floodplain expands by 145 square miles, tripling the exposure.\n\nThat one-two punch is a combo that few current models account for.\n\n“The studies that have been conducted so far ... haven’t really taken into account the long-term impacts of the subsidence,” Dura notes.\n\nThe result: a massive blind spot in our understanding of flood risk in the Pacific Northwest. And without that knowledge, thousands of homeowners might be dramatically underestimating their need for flood insurance.\n\nWhat homeowners can do now to understand and reduce risk\n\nJust one inch of floodwater can cause up to $25,000 in damage, according to FEMA. Yet, as Janet Ruiz of the Insurance Information Institute warns, flood damage and “damage from a tsunami is not covered under most standard homeowners, renters, or business insurance.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor homeowners in the Pacific Northwest, Dura’s study offers a critical opportunity to get ahead of that risk.\n\n“Residents can use our maps to locate themselves ... to see whether their house might lie within one of the projected post-earthquake floodplains,” she says.\n\nEven homes outside FEMA-designated flood zones could be pulled into future floodplains in an instant, making flood insurance a smart move now, before disaster strikes.\n\n“The major insurer of flood is the National Flood Insurance Program ... [which] provides coverage up to $250,000 for a structure and $100,000 for personal possessions,” Ruiz notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat might not be enough. Flooding following a tsunami triggered by the megathrust earthquake could destroy entire homes, not just damage the first floor, so owners of higher-value homes might need additional protection.\n\nAnd the risk isn’t only long-term. Areas newly vulnerable to subsidence might also start experiencing nuisance flooding, king tides, and coastal erosion well before the next major quake hits.\n\n“Twenty-five percent of flooding happens outside the designated flood zones,” Ruiz adds, which makes proactive planning even more essential.\n\nHomeowners should start by taking the following steps:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLocating their property on Dura’s projected floodplain maps.\n\nComparing National Flood Insurance Program policies with options from private insurers.\n\nReassessing their property’s flood risk based on elevation, proximity to water, and changing coastal conditions.\n\nHow likely is this ‘next great quake’?\n\nScientists refer to recurrence intervals to estimate how often major earthquakes occur on a given fault. For the Cascadia Subduction Zone, the geological record shows a pattern of megathrust quakes occurring roughly every 250 to 800 years.\n\n“We’re over 300 years out from the last earthquake,” says Dura. “Geologically speaking, we’re well within the window of possibility.”\n\nIn human terms, that can seem abstract, but the odds are very real. Unlike storms or seasonal weather events, earthquakes strike without warning, and the longer the buildup, the greater the risk.\n\n“Fifty years in geologic time is well within our plus or minus uncertainty,” Dura adds. “It really could happen any day.”"

        "content": "A popular ski resort town in Colorado is adopting a new AI Smart City Solution from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to help it better detect wildfires, as well as update a range of other city services.\n\nVail is expanding its firefighting toolbox as hotter, more arid weather with climate change raises wildfire risk in the western US. Colorado has suffered 11 of the 20 largest fires in state history just within the last five years. Researchers and first responders are increasingly exploring ways in which new AI tools might help them get ahead of blazes.\n\n“Fires are part of our life [now] in the mountains, and we have to be prepared for them,” Vail town manager Russell Forrest tells The Verge.\n\n“Fires are part of our life.”\n\nThe collaboration with HPE for wildfire detection came together quickly this year, as Forrest was keeping an eye on a wildfire burning about 30 miles away from his town in July. “One of the things that became very apparent with that fire is that rapid detection of the fire and then the response to that made a big difference and will continue to make a difference in terms of managing future fires where we are,” he says.\n\nForrest connected with HPE and the company Kamiwaza, which has developed an AI orchestration platform, to ask how AI might be able to help the town. Now, Vail is the first municipality in the US to adopt HPE’s new “smart city solution,“ developed alongside Kamiwaza, Nvidia, and several other tech companies.\n\nThe aim is to make it quicker and easier to analyze footage the town already takes using cameras placed on buses and high vantage points on the mountains. Until now, it was primarily people who analyzed those videos trying to spot signs of fire and sometimes being stymied by whether what they saw was smoke or fog. They might have to send people out to a place where there appeared to be a lightning strike to see if it had sparked a blaze.\n\nThe new AI-enhanced system can restore higher fidelity in the images if needed and then apply video analytics against it, HPE vice president of AI and hybrid cloud business development Robin Braun explains. It’s been trained to identify lightning strikes and smoke in real time. On the agentic back end, the Kamiwaza platform adds additional context like weather indications (has it been snowing lately or is there a red flag warning in effect?) that might indicate how serious of an event this is and how to respond.\n\nIn addition, geospatial data analysis provided by Blackshark.ai is also incorporated into the smart city system. It can utilize drone and satellite images to assess how dry or healthy vegetation is as a measure of fire risk, as well as see how close fire-prone brush is to homes to figure out what needs to be cleared.\n\nVail isn’t alone in testing out new AI tools for fire detection. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has developed an experimental Next Generation Fire System (NGFS) to automate fire detection from satellite imagery. It searches for heat anomalies to detect fires and then sends alerts through an online dashboard that debuted in February to keep first responders and other officials informed.\n\nA conundrum with all the excitement around using AI to detect fires is that the boom of new energy-hungry AI data centers has also led to a spate of new fossil fuel projects. Planet-heating pollution from new oil and gas infrastructure can literally add fuel to the fire by exacerbating climate change.\n\nEnergy demand is something Forrest says he considered, too, before implementing the new program. HPE’s smart city platform will run out of a nearby data center that is primarily powered by renewable energy. The data center is plugged into the local power grid with electricity provided by Holy Cross Energy, a rural electric co-op that says that 76 percent of its portfolio in 2024 was made of renewable energy (mostly wind). That’s a higher proportion than the nation as a whole; only about 20 percent of the US electricity mix comes from renewables.\n\nWildfire detection and prevention are only one piece of HPE’s smart city platform. Vail also plans to use it to streamline administrative tasks, including reviewing housing permits and business license applications, make sure municipal websites are in compliance with federal laws ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities, and more. A new “digital concierge” at the public library is supposed to help provide information to residents and visitors. The town of just 4,300 residents is inundated with up to 30,000 visitors a day during peak ski season, and the hope is that the AI platform can free up staff to tackle the most pressing priorities."

        "content": "This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nFueled by unusually warm waters, Hurricane Melissa this week turned into one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded. Now a new rapid attribution study suggests human-induced climate change made the deadly tropical cyclone four times more likely.\n\nHurricane Melissa collided with Jamaica on Tuesday, wreaking havoc across the island before tearing through nearby Haiti and Cuba. The storm, which reached Category 5, reserved for the hurricanes with the most powerful winds, has killed at least 40 people across the Caribbean so far. Now weakened to a Category 2, it continues its path toward Bermuda, where landfall is likely on Thursday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nEarly reports of the damage are cataclysmic, particularly in hardest-hit western Jamaica. Winds reaching speeds of 185 miles per hour and torrential rain flattened entire neighborhoods, decimated large swaths of agricultural lands and forced more than 25,000 people—locals and tourists alike—to seek cover in shelters or hotel ballrooms. According to the new attribution study from Imperial College London, climate change ramped up Melissa’s wind speeds by 7 percent, which increased damages by 12 percent.\n\nLosses could add up to tens of billions of dollars, experts say.\n\nThe findings echo similar reports released earlier this week on how global warming contributed to the likelihood and severity of Hurricane Melissa. Each of the analyses add to a growing body of research showing how ocean warming from climate change is fueling the conditions necessary for stronger tropical storms.\n\nHurricane Melissa is “kind of a textbook example of what we expect in terms of how hurricanes respond to a warming climate,” said Brian Soden, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami, who was not involved in the recent analyses. “We know that the warming ocean temperatures [are] being driven almost exclusively by increasing greenhouse gases.”\n\nThe storm has disrupted every aspect of life in this part of the Caribbean.\n\n“There’s been massive dislocation of services. We have people living in shelters across the country,” Dennis Zulu, United Nations resident coordinator in Jamaica, said in a press conference on Wednesday. “What we are seeing in preliminary assessments is a country that’s been devastated to levels never seen before.”\n\nThe Climate Connection\n\nFor the rapid attribution study, researchers at Imperial College used the peer-reviewed Imperial College Storm Model, known as IRIS, which has created a database of millions of synthetic tropical cyclone tracks that can help fill in gaps on how storms operate in the real world.\n\nThe model essentially runs simulations on the likelihood of a given storm’s wind speed—often the most damaging factor—in a pre-industrial climate versus the current climate. Applying IRIS to Hurricane Melissa is how the researchers determined that human-induced warming supercharged the cyclone’s wind speed by 7 percent."

        "content": "Jamaicans take stock after hurricane causes damage, flooding and power cuts\n\n29 October 2025 Share Save Nick Davis , Mandeville and Rachel Hagan Share Save\n\nEPA A woman surveys the damage to her home in northern Jamaica\n\nJamaicans are taking stock after Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to strike the island in modern history, barrelled across the country leaving behind a trail of ruin. Without power or phone coverage, much of the country is isolated and so information is trickling through. Authorities were only able to confirm the first deaths as a result of the hurricane over 24 hours after landfall. The bodies of three men and one woman were washed up by the flood waters in St Elizabeth Parish, local government minister Desmond McKenzie said. There, Prime Minister Andrew Holness said \"images of destruction are all around\". \"The damage is great, but we are going to devote all our energy to mount a strong recovery,\" he said. Three-quarters of the country are still without power, according to the latest media briefing. On the road west out of the capital Kingston we saw minimal damage - some structures torn down, trees strewn across roads and gardens. But once we arrived in central Jamaica we started to see how severely the island has been hit. The town of Mandeville has been, for want of a better word, flattened. A petrol station had lost its roof and most of its pumps. The main road that runs through the town is littered in debris, foliage is stuck to everything and bits of building material were scattered along the road. By early Wednesday the hurricane had made landfall in Cuba, causing flooding and damage. In Haiti more than 25 people were killed, most when a river burst its banks in Petit-Goave, the local mayor said. At its peak, the hurricane sustained winds of 298 km/h (185 mph) - stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 and killed 1,392 people. It has since weakened to a Category 3 hurricane.\n\nHurricane Melissa - what we know about the damage in Jamaica\n\nAs wind and rain lashed through the night, one local Jamaican official said the destruction resembled \"the scene of an apocalypse movie\". Many parts of Jamaica's western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds after the hurricane tore across the island with catastrophic force. People have shared clips of roads that became rivers, mudslides on the hills, roofs being ripped from buildings and palm trees tossed like tooth picks. In the town of Black River on the south-west coast, police officer Warrell Nicholson was sheltering in the damaged police station along with some residents. \"It's been devastating,\" he told the AFP news agency. Further up the coast, Andrew Houston Moncure was sheltering in the luxury hotel he owns, with his wife and 20-month-old son. At the height of the hurricane they barricaded themselves inside the shower, which they fortified with pillows and blankets. \"It was the most terrifying experience, especially with my son. The pressure is so low you struggle to breathe, and it just sounds like a freight train going over you,\" he told AFP. Across Jamaica's central parishes, flood waters rose to the roofs of two-storey homes, Kingston-based journalist Kimone Francis of The Jamaica Gleaner said. Verna Genus, a 73-year-old vegetable farmer, was sheltering from the storm with her sons and baby grandchild at her four-bedroom home in the village of Carlisle, St Elizabeth, when the hurricane ripped the zinc roof off her house. \"She was crying on the phone,\" her UK-based sister June said, adding: \"You are huddled up inside and then you look up then the roof is gone. I have never heard her like that - she was wailing 'we are all finished'.\" She is anxiously waiting for communications networks to be restored so she can talk to her sister. St Elizabeth, known as Jamaica's breadbasket, produces much of the island's produce. With crops submerged and fields destroyed, many farmers will struggle to financially recover. Jamaica's prime minister told the BBC in some instances \"there was total devastation\" and that one town named Black River had been \"totally destroyed\".\n\nOn the north coast, Montego Bay - the heart of Jamaica's tourism industry and home to its main airport - will also take time to get back on its feet. Montego city was split in two by flood waters, Mayor Richard Vernon said. He told BBC Breakfast: \"Once the wind subsided, we started to get a lot of heavy rain and that has led to massive floods right across the city. One side of the city is now cut off from the other due to roads being inundated by flood water.\" His immediate concern, he added, was simple: \"Check if everybody is alive.\" In rural Jamaica, the storm has left people shaken. Tamisha Lee, president of the Jamaica Network of Rural Women Producers, said: \"Right now, what I'm seeing is heavy rain, powerful wind, a lot of things flying all over the place, and trees uprooted. There is no electricity. I am feeling anxious and tense. The damage will be enormous.\" Meteorologists said Hurricane Melissa intensified at a speed rarely seen, its rapid strengthening fuelled by abnormally warm Caribbean waters - part of a broader trend linked to climate change. By the time it struck Jamaica, the storm had reached Category 5 strength, with gusts fierce enough to tear roofs from concrete homes, uproot trees and snap power poles. Health officials even issued a crocodile warning, cautioning that flood waters could drive the reptiles into residential areas. For thousands of tourists caught on the island, the storm brought terror and uncertainty."

The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. Rescuers located two bodies, and are still searching for the remaining five, who are believed to have been buried by snow. Eight others have been rescued and are in the capital Kathmandu getting treatment for their injuries. All these climbers were part of a group that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told BBC Nepali.\n\nThe bodies of the other five deceased climbers \"may be 10-15 feet below the snow\", said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks. \"It will take time to find them.\" Those killed include two Italians, a Canadian, a German, a French national, and two Nepalis who served as guides. Local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC on Monday that a rescue helicopter had landed in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp. One of the injured climbers told The Kathmandu Post that they had repeatedly called for help, to no avail. \"Had the rescue arrived on time, more lives could have been saved,\" he told the newspaper. Mr Mahato told reporters that rescue efforts were hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, which made it hard to fly helicopters or reach the site on foot. The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft). They had planned to climb the 5,630m Yalung Ri as part of their acclimatisation schedule."

Many of the roads are blocked by debris and people are isolated with little food, no power or running water, and no idea of when normalcy will return. The government said on Saturday that at least 28 people in Jamaica have died since the hurricane hit as a monster category five storm with 185 mph (297km/h) sustained winds. That is a near 50% jump in the death toll overnight, and the number could rise as officials clear their way into new parts of the island in the coming days. Local official Dr Dayton Campbell told the BBC 10 of those deaths were in Westmoreland. Westmoreland parish is believed to have the second highest number of unconfirmed deaths, after St Elizabeth to the south east. The eye of the storm hit somewhere between the two neighbouring parishes. At St Elizabeth an estimated 90% of homes have been destroyed.\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC News A town just outside of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish sits in ruins\n\nA long stretch of road headed west into Westmoreland Parish winds through a graveyard of trees – stacks of branches and limbs, cracked and twisted, blanketing the landscape for miles. It is grim evidence of Hurricane Melissa's ferocity - it was the strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history. Piles of debris are heaped on the parish's roadsides, next to battered buildings, shipping crates turned on their side and crowds of people wading through the destruction. On Saturday morning, men with machetes hacked through branches as thick as their arms, clearing patches of the road where traffic jams were at a standstill. A policeman with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest, part of a convoy accompanying an aid truck on its way to Westmoreland, hopped out of his vehicle to help direct traffic. \"We don't know what lies ahead,\" the officer told the BBC, describing what he has seen as \"total devastation\".\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Roy Perry says he has lost everything in the wake of the strongest hurricane in Jamaican history\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Anthony Burnett (left) and Gary Williams (right)\n\nThose living in Whitehouse, a coastal town and commercial hub on the edge of Westmoreland Parish, say the wait for assistance is becoming frustrating. Gary Williams said he has heard promises of incoming aid delivery, but \"they no turn up\". He sat in the shade on a makeshift stool in front of a building barely standing – its entire roof gone – unsure of what to do next. Williams said he lost his house in the storm and has \"nowhere to live\", suggesting he might sleep right where he is, outside on the front porch. Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Words can't explain the situation that we're in. It's horrible. I don't even know what to say. So many hopeless, helpless and lifeless people here right now.\"\n\nAbout 400,000 people in Jamaica were without power as of Friday, and an untold number more have no access to cell phone service or Wi-Fi, cut off from the outside world. Jamaica's transportation minister Daryl Vaz announced on Saturday that more than 200 StarLink devices have been deployed across the island to help people access the internet. He addressed criticism the government has received for its response, saying there were \"several factors\" contributing to delays. \"Refuelling, Areas for Landing, Accessibility and Timing/Visibility,\" Vaz said on X. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged that the \"immediate focus is on clearing debris, restoring essential services\", as well as providing food and medical supplies. But that would only solve part of the problem.\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Residents of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish try to piece their lives back together\n\nIn a tiny community just outside of Whitehouse, Robert Morris rested against a slab of broken concrete. Behind him, the fishing village he has called home his entire life has been destroyed, along with his livelihood. \"We all devastated here, man,\" he said. He said the boat house was destroyed and is now \"flat\". \"Melissa take everything down,\" he said, including his fishing boat, which he describes as \"mashed up\". Morris also told of \"no help, no food, no water\". \"We just have to try and see what we can do,\" he said, adding that his plan was to find someone whose boat was still intact so that he could join and fish. Even then, he is not sure where he would sell his catch. The people in these areas are filled with pride and resilience, words that are often repeated on local radio stations and visible through their optimism in the most difficult circumstances. Seated under the facade of a badly damaged building, Roy Perry said he has lost everything, but \"we have to just keep the faith and the hope is up still\".\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Robert Morris fishing village in view over his right shoulder has been entirely destroyed\n\nBrandon Drenon / BBC Oreth Jones, a local farmer, said his farm was \"all wrecked\""

        "content": "Seismometers picked up the ferocious winds and waves of Hurricane Melissa, showing how the tools can be used to better understand storms today and those from the past\n\nHurricane Melissa will go down as one of the worst hurricanes ever in the Atlantic Ocean, with the hurricane reaching a strength that only a handful of storms have achieved in recorded history. Melissa was so powerful—with astounding 185-mile-per-hour peak winds—that it literally made the ground tremble hundreds of miles away in Florida, where its march across the ocean was picked up on seismometers, instruments designed to detect earthquakes.\n\nThough plenty of intense storms have shown up on these sensors before, the recordings underscore the destructive force of the Melissa, a Category 5 hurricane that devastated parts of Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. They also highlight how a tool that is typically used for geological purposes can improve our understanding of one Earth’s most ferocious weather phenomena—in particular, by opening a window into the hurricanes that raged before satellites and plane reconnaissance was possible.\n\nDespite seismic waves being readily associated with fault movements and their tremors, “seismometers aren’t just used for earthquakes,” says seismologist and earthquake geologist Wendy Bohon, whose organizational affiliation can’t currently be given because of the ongoing shutdown of the federal government. “Seismometers detect anything that puts energy into the ground. That could be Taylor Swift concerts; that could be construction; that could be people walking around seismometers.” Landslides, avalanches, asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions and clandestine nuclear weapons explosions all appear as curious squiggles in the tools’ output because they all generate seismic waves.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nHurricanes and typhoons are no exception, and they wobble Earth’s crust in two different ways. The first is “due to the wind vibrating trees, telegraph poles, fenceposts, etcetera, which then couples into the ground as a seismic wave,” says Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at University College London.\n\nThe second, more major component comes from the storms jostling the ocean itself. “As waves go up and down, they drum on the ocean floor,” Bohon says. Sometimes this percussive action is represented on seismometers by subtle peaks and troughs. Hurricane Melissa ominously registered on Jamaica’s seismometers as eerily obvious serrated teeth in the days leading up to landfall. “It makes your heart drop a little bit because you recognize the ferocity of the storm,” Bohon says.\n\nHurricanes and typhoons are tracked and studied relatively easily in real time: barometers and daring “Hurricane Hunter” pilots record changes in air pressure, oceanic sensors monitor changing temperatures, and satellites can build three-dimensional pictures of these maelstroms. Seismometers, which run continuously and can be found all over the world, can also be used to track the trajectory of the hurricane, says Andreas Fichtner, a seismologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.\n\nDownload the video EarthScope Consortium\n\nAlthough helpful in the here and now, this is particularly useful for understanding hurricanes in the somewhat more antiquated past—back when aerial surveys and satellite sleuthing weren’t options. “In the presatellite era, we already had a seismic network on the surface of the Earth,” Fichtner says. It’s not anywhere near as dense as it is today, but it’s still sufficient for hurricane researchers hoping to rewind time so they can find out where tropical cyclones used to be born and where the storms previously dissolved away.\n\nThis multidecadal seismic soundtrack also shows potential in determining the intensities of past hurricanes. Storm-generated seismic waves are effectively recording changes in ocean wave height. That means scientists could calibrate the cacophony of today’s hurricanes with their intensity and then use what’s preserved in old seismic catalogs to see if cyclones have become stronger over time.\n\nAs sea-surface temperatures have risen dramatically with global warming, climate models have predicted that, over the coming years, hurricanes will get stronger, bringing higher wind speeds, greater rainfall and more vigorous storm surges to bear on anyone in their paths. There are some indications that this effect is already in play. And if, as recent research suggests, seismometers can determine the strength of tropical storms that existed long ago, our understanding of this trend will undoubtedly improve.\n\nThe fact that seismometers can be used in an unconventional way to study our rapidly changing world is fascinating, Bohon says. But seeing increasingly savage storms such as Melissa appear on these sensors is also “frightening and heartbreaking,” she adds."

        "content": "FEMA promised funds to tsunami-proof an Oregon hospital. That money is MIA\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\nEight years ago, Erik Thorsen — CEO of Columbia Memorial Hospital in Astoria, Ore. — received a warning that no hospital administrator wants to hear: A big earthquake could cause his hospital's building to collapse. His staff and his patients could die in a matter of moments.\n\n\"They basically said, 'None of you are prepared for a major natural disaster from the Cascadia subduction zone,'\" recalls Thorsen.\n\nThe Cascadia subduction zone is an earthquake-prone region that stretches about 700 miles from California to British Columbia. Thorsen's hospital sits right along it — which is why a team of experts and engineers from the state had come to talk to him and other leaders from coastal hospitals about earthquake risk.\n\nAlarmed, Thorsen — who grew up in this area, left for college, and then returned to raise his family here — got to work fundraising and planning in order to fortify his hospital to withstand an earthquake and provide shelter during a tsunami.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA critical part of the project's $300 million budget was to come from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Their $14 million grant would help to build a tsunami evacuation zone in the hospital.\n\nBut in April, the Trump administration canceled the grant program that awarded the funding, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. A report from the Urban Institute estimates this cancellation jeopardizes over $3 billion nationally in hazard mitigation funds to protect communities from threats like floods, wildfires, tornadoes and hurricanes.\n\nWhen the news reached Astoria, construction plans were already well under way.\n\n\"We did go back to the design team and say, 'What would it take to actually take these elements out?'\" says Mark Kujala, a Clatsop County commissioner who worked on fundraising for the project. \"And because it's so integrated into the project, that just wasn't feasible.\"\n\nThe hospital broke ground in September. The current plan for filling the $14 million hole left by FEMA: There is no plan.\n\n\"Unfortunately, FEMA — even prior to the shutdown, had kind of gone silent on us,\" says Thorsen. \"And now with the shutdown … very silent on us.\"\n\nNo worse place to locate a hospital\n\nColumbia Memorial Hospital was constructed in its current location in 1977, when earthquake risk was not as well understood. In addition to being constructed in a zone vulnerable to a major earthquake, the hospital sits in a low-lying plain just blocks from the waterfront, on unstable ground.\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\n\"The theory is if the earthquake happened, that ground underneath us would liquefy and the building would potentially collapse,\" says Thorsen. \"If we happen to remain upright and a tsunami comes our way, maybe we get 20 to 30 minutes of notice to evacuate people up the hill.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat would mean moving vulnerable patients — in some cases, critically ill patients — out of their environment and into another, in the middle of a disaster zone, in a matter of minutes. Other earthquake-prone places like Japan have already built such structures to avoid this scenario by moving to higher ground within their buildings. But Oregon is late to the game, some experts say.\n\n\" We're sitting here on — you know the overused phrase — [a] ticking time bomb,\" says Chris Goldfinger, who studies paleoseismology at Oregon State University.\n\nA magnitude 9 earthquake, says Goldfinger, is a realistic possibility in the Cascadia subduction zone.\n\n\"Those happen on average just under [once every] 500 years,\" says Goldfinger. \"We're 325 years since the last one.\"\n\nAt least 25,000 people could die in this scenario, according to some estimates.\n\nThere are only three hospitals in Oregon in this region.\n\n\"Honestly, with this project, we could be the only hospital that could survive and serve the residents — for about 60,000 people,\" says Thorsen. \"It's a big responsibility.\"\n\nCurrently the hospital is a sprawling, one-story building, and modeling has predicted that several feet of water could flood the hospital's ground floor during a tsunami. When it is complete, the new hospital will be dramatically taller, growing from one story to four (plus a fifth level for a helipad). The idea behind the vertical evacuation zone is that once the earthquake has stopped and the new building is still standing, people can congregate in the top several floors, built especially to be able to withstand a tsunami.\n\ntoggle caption ZGF Architects\n\nIn order to help mitigate that potential disaster, engineers designed a plan to anchor the hospital to bedrock 65 feet deep. \"The building is 97 feet and the helipad sits on the roof,\" says Thorsen, gesturing to the hospital and describing its new design. A 100-foot drill — basically an enormous version of the kind of drill bit one might find in a household toolbox — is already making deep holes to secure the piles.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough the Pacific Northwest is beginning to build these kinds of structures, Goldfinger says, they're hard to finance without federal support. \"The federal government is really the only entity that's large enough to deal with this as a national-level problem,\" he says. \"It's just well beyond anything that the states could do alone.\"\n\n\"It is just incredibly frustrating\"\n\nThough Thorsen and his staff say they were given some indication that existing BRIC grants would still be distributed, they've yet to see any money.\n\nThe BRIC program was established under the first Trump administration in order to fortify communities against natural disasters. After it was canceled, a lawsuit challenged the program's termination and a federal judge issued an injunction.\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\n\"It is just incredibly frustrating,\" says Democratic Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, who represents the area. Bonamici says she and her staff have been pleading with anyone who will listen to help access the money.\n\n\" I lost count of how many calls I have made, trying to get somebody from FEMA on the phone,\" says Bonamici.\n\nFEMA did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nPlans for a new hospital, says Bonamici, provided her peace of mind about a potential catastrophe in her district. Some predictions forecast a magnitude 9 earthquake here could be the worst natural disaster the U.S. has ever seen.\n\n\"It is going to be a safe place not just for patients or employees in the hospital, but for the community, \" says Bonamici. \"They can't outrun a tsunami. \"\n\nIn addition to saving lives, she says, the project will save property and money. \"It is really critical that — now that they're underway with construction — this funding comes through.\"\n\nWaste, fraud, and abuse hits different at a local level\n\nWhen Trump officials started talking about cutting \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" Willis Van Dusen was enthusiastic. A registered Republican, Van Dusen was mayor of Astoria for more than two decades. Eliminating waste, he says, is what he and fellow Republicans wanted.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"This is what Trump ran on,\" he says.\n\nBut when Trump's \"waste, fraud and abuse\" campaign came to his town, Van Dusen says he felt differently. \"What is more important than a hospital in a rural community like Astoria?\" he asks.\n\nAstoria has a history as a fishing and logging town, but more recently it's given way to big-city retirees and craft breweries. It's a rare, politically moderate area — a place, says Van Dusen, where neighborhoods are socioeconomically mixed and people are typically more concerned with questions of practical issues like trash collection than identity politics.\n\nFew issues are more practical than having a trusted hospital nearby, says Van Dusen. When he had a heart attack some years ago, it was doctors at Columbia Memorial who brought him back. \"I had actually died,\" he says, pointing to a framed EKG reading he keeps in his office.\n\ntoggle caption Jay Fram for NPR\n\nMaking sure that this hospital can keep providing care during an earthquake and tsunami, he says, is the opposite of waste, fraud and abuse.\n\n\"Just to jerk that money away from us,\" he says, \"it makes me livid.\"\n\nVan Dusen says he's not the only one in this town who's mad, regardless of political party. \"Every single Republican that I have talked to is livid over what's happening,\" he adds.\n\nHospital CEO Erik Thorsen says they are not giving up — even without the federal money. Construction continues. They've been thinking through other ways to finance it.\n\nThorsen feels a responsibility for protecting this community where he has spent most of his life. \"We have this obligation to make sure that our patients and our residents and citizens are safe,\" he says.\n\nWithout the federal government, though, the path ahead is unclear.\n\n"

It was the strongest storm to hit Jamaica in the island's record-keeping history, in addition to one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. That was due to its winds and pressure, which are two primary markers of intensity.\n\nThe hurricane's maximum winds had reached a formidable 185 mph when it collided with the southwestern coast of Jamaica, near the town of New Hope. Although their speed dipped somewhat in the hours after landfall, Melissa's winds remained well above the 157-mph threshold that the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale sets to determine the minimum criteria for a Category 5 storm.\n\nA satellite image shows the Barnett River along Montego Bay in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica, October 29, 2025.

McKenzie said police found their bodies washed up by flood waters and determined that all four were \"by all indications, direct victims of the Hurricane.\"\n\nMore than 25,000 people were still crowded in shelters on the island on Wednesday, after the storm temporarily displaced some residents and left others homeless.\n\nIn the top row, farmlands in Santa Cruz, Jamaica, are pictured before and after Hurricane Melissa, with the latter image showing the land flooded with muddy water.

The storm was moving away from the Bahamas on Thursday morning and headed toward Bermuda, according to the National Hurricane Center."

Conditions will improve basin-wide by Tuesday evening.\n\nIn the Caribbean Sea: A surface trough in the W Caribbean is aiding in the development of scattered moderate convection across the offshore waters of Honduras and Nicaragua. The pressure gradient between high pressure over the western and central Atlantic and the Colombian low is supporting fresh to strong trades over the south-central Caribbean, and moderate to fresh trades elsewhere in the central and eastern basin. Light to gentle winds are over the NW Caribbean. Seas are moderate, except slight in the NW Caribbean.\n\nFor the forecast, moderate to fresh trade winds will prevail over the central and eastern Caribbean through Tuesday, as a surface trough moves westward through the region, and high pressure builds to the north. Locally strong winds and rough seas are expected in the south-central and portions of the north-central Caribbean during the weekend and on Monday. Rough seas in N swell will continue over the tropical Atlantic waters east of the Lesser Antilles into Monday and then will gradually subside through late Tuesday. Looking ahead, a strong cold front is slated to enter the NW Caribbean late Monday, leading to widespread strong to near gale force N winds and rough seas in the wake of the front.

        "content": "Elon Musk said AI will make desk jobs now feel like when workers used to make calculations by hand before the computer age.\n\n\"I think there will be actually a high demand for jobs, but not necessarily the same jobs,\" Musk recently told Joe Rogan on the comedian's podcast. \"So I mean this is actually, this process has been happening throughout modern history.\"\n\nThe xAI CEO says AI is already replacing and will continue to replace desk jobs that are digitally centric, \"at an accelerated rate.\"\n\n\"It's just happening,\" Musk said. \"Like I said, AI is the supersonic tsunami.\"\n\nNot all jobs are immediately threatened. Musk, like most economists who have studied the topic, said that physical labor jobs and careers that require some element of human interaction are likely to stay around.\n\n\"Anything that's physically moving atoms, like cooking food or farming, anything that's physical, those jobs will exist for a much longer time,\" he said. \"But anything that is digital, which is just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning.\"\n\nMusk is mostly bullish on the long-term benefits of artificial intelligence, provided a Terminator-esque scenario doesn't come to fruition.\n\nIn a much more \"benign scenario,\" Musk said, wealth will be accessible to virtually everyone, leading to a \"universal high income.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, working will be optional because you'll have robots plus AI,\" he said. \"And we'll have, in a benign scenario, universal high income, not just universal basic income. Universal high income, meaning anyone can have any products or services that they want, but there will be a lot of trauma and disruption along the way.\"\n\nMusk's final point about \"trauma and disruption\" lies at the heart of the debate roiling AI and tech.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said earlier this year that AI could eliminate up to half of entry-level white collar jobs within the next five years. Other tech leaders, including OpenAI's Sam Altman, have questioned Amodei's outlook.\n\nMusk said that his ideal version of the future \"kind of sounds like heaven.\" Rogan said that without worrying about work, people can now spend their days doing whatever they want.\n\n\"Like I said, not every path is a good path,\" Musk said. \"But I think if we push it in the direction of maximally truth-seeking and curious, then I think AI will want to take care of humanity and foster humanity because we're interesting.\""

        "content": "The updates sent by friends and neighbors on WhatsApp confirmed what fisher Prince Davis already feared: Hurricane Melissa put a hole in the stern of his 50-foot (15-meter) fishing boat, and damaged the cabin and back deck.\n\nHis father's boat was nowhere to be found. The roof of the house Davis and his parents shared in the small Jamaican fishing community of White House in Westmoreland parish was also destroyed.\n\nDavis was in Nicaragua, where he'd flown shortly before the storm to find new customers for his fish business. But now his livelihood, and the livelihoods of many in his community, were in peril.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“It’s going to be very rough” said Davis. “With the damage now, no one will be buying products.”\n\nAbout 29 kilometers (17 miles) northwest in Amity, also in Westmoreland parish, Denver Thorpe lost 15 acres (6 hectares) of mango trees and two greenhouses on his farm.\n\n“There’s absolutely nothing,” said Thorpe, a farmer and regional manager for the Jamaica Agricultural Society, a farmer advocacy organization.\n\nHurricane Melissa is blamed for at least 28 deaths in Jamaica, bringing catastrophic winds up to 185 mph (298 kph) and storm surge that wrecked homes and public infrastructure.\n\nWhile official damage assessments are still underway, experts said it's already clear that one of the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded also dealt a devastating blow to tens of thousands of Jamaican fishers and farmers who feed their families and nearby communities.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSimilar impacts will be felt by some of Cuba and Haiti ’s small producers, said Lola Castro, World Food Program regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n“I would say every (crop) that was on the path has been damaged, there’s no discussion on that,” said Castro. “Some of the fruit trees may be recovered, some of the temporary crops will not be recovered at all.”\n\nThe destruction will impact how residents earn income and feed their families at a time when they must also rebuild homes and communities. There were already 10 million food-insecure people across the affected countries of Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, said Castro. The WFP does not have that data for Cuba.\n\nIn Jamaica, the destruction comes just 15 months after Hurricane Beryl impacted more than 50,000 farmers and 11,000 fishers, and caused $4.73 billion Jamaican dollars (about $29 million) in losses, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“We were just about turning the corner,” said Thorpe.\n\n‘The lifeblood of the most vulnerable’\n\nJamaica’s agriculture ministry did not respond to questions about sector impacts, but the country has more than 200,000 farmers tending livestock and growing bananas, melons, cocoa and much more.\n\nThe food produced is for domestic consumption and export — Jamaica is one of the world's largest yam exporters and its coffee growers generate $25 million annually, according to the Jamaica Coffee Exporters Association.\n\nAround 80% are small-scale producers, working on 2 hectares of land or less, said Donovan Campbell, geography professor and director of the University of the West Indies’ western campus.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Small-scale fishing and small-scale farming is what most people use to make a living,” he said. “It is really the lifeblood of the most vulnerable in our society.”\n\nFarmers use October rains to plant crops to harvest before Christmas. Before the storm, the agriculture ministry urged fishers to move equipment out of harm's way and farmers to move livestock and harvest any crops they could.\n\nThe devastation exceeded most expectations. Officials Wednesday said St. Elizabeth parish, known as Jamaica's “breadbasket,\" was “ under water.\" The parish had over 35,000 registered farmers and fishers as of 2022, according to the Jamaica Information Service.\n\nFor fishers, Davis said it's not just losing boats, nets and traps that endangers their work. Without electricity, there’s no ice to store what they catch, and customers won’t buy what they can’t keep cold. Lack of tourism will hurt demand, too.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe slowdown is worse for fishers who use most of their catch to feed their families and sell a little extra, he said. “That small income every day maintains their house and their family and their school and children.\"\n\nThere are also special risks for women producers, said Davis and Campbell, many of whom are heads of household who support their children with the small amounts they sell.\n\nCompounding crises in Cuba and Haiti\n\nCuba and Haiti face similar challenges, exacerbated by their political and economic crises.\n\nThe storm unleashed terrible flooding in southern Haiti and is blamed for 31 deaths in the country, where hunger was already rising.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCastro of the World Food Program said the organization is concerned about the impact to some of Haiti's female producers, from whom the WFP typically buys produce to supply local schools.\n\n“We may need to bring food from other parts of the country if available or even having to import,” said Castro.\n\nIn Cuba, the evacuation of 735,000 people meant the country suffered no known deaths, but Melissa’s passage could worsen challenges in feeding Cubans. The country faces a severe economic crisis and spends some $2 billion annually importing food products.\n\nLocal officials said there was damage to plantain, corn and cassava crops, coffee, various vegetables and trees across the five affected eastern provinces.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGovernment officials said Melissa’s heavy rainfall did benefit dams and reservoirs, after the eastern part of the country had been suffering from a severe drought and water shortage.\n\n“That is one of the silver linings,” said Margarita Fernandez, executive director of the Caribbean Agroecology Institute in Vermont. CAI is raising funds to send directly to farmers and cooperatives there. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization also delivered seed to Cuba ahead of the storm, a spokesperson said.\n\nHelp arrives in phases\n\nRelief efforts across the northern Caribbean are focused on immediate needs for now, as first responders and humanitarian organizations provide shelter, health care, food and clean water, and restore power and communications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFood producers will soon need cash to make up for lost income, help replacing equipment and animals as well as new seed.\n\nThe Jamaican government keeps reserve funds, parametric insurance policies and catastrophe bonds for disasters. The government and nonprofits helped farmers and fishers after Hurricane Beryl replace what they lost.\n\nBut it can take a long time for that help to reach small scale producers, said Campbell.\n\nWith airports open again, Davis is looking for a flight to get back to White House. He needs to fix his boat, and his roof, but he doesn't know when he will sell fish again.\n\n“My worry is about when will the economy will be back to normal, where life goes on as it was before,” said Davis. “Everyone is picking up the pieces.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Andrea Rodríguez contributed reporting from Havana."

Dixon said 77% of the island was without power.\n\nThe outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.\n\n\"Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement. \"Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly.\"\n\nOfficials in Black River, Jamaica, a southwestern coastal town of approximately 5,000 people, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing,\" Mayor Richard Solomon said.\n\nSolomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm. The hospital, police units and emergency services were inundated by floods and unable to conduct emergency operations.\n\nJamaican Transportation Minister Daryl Vaz said two of the island's airports will reopen Wednesday to relief flights only, with U.N. agencies and dozens of nonprofits on standby to distribute basic goods.\n\ntoggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP\n\n\"The devastation is enormous,\" he said. \"We need all hands on deck to recover stronger and to help those in need at this time.\"\n\nThe United States is sending rescue and response teams to assist in recovery efforts in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X.\n\nSt. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto told Nationwide News Network on Wednesday that authorities have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. One death was reported in the west when a tree fell on a baby, state minister Abka Fitz-Henley told Nationwide News Network.\n\nBefore landfall, Melissa had already been blamed for three deaths in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMelissa devastates Haitian town\n\nHurricane Melissa damaged more than 160 homes and destroyed 80 others in the town of Petit-Goâve, where 10 of the 20 people killed there were children, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday.\n\nLawyer Charly Saint-Vil, 30, said he saw bodies lying among the debris after the storm as he walked the streets of the small coastal town where he grew up. People screamed as they searched for their missing children, he said.\n\n\"People have lost everything,\" Saint-Vil said.\n\nAlthough the immediate threat of the storm has passed, Saint-Vil said Petit-Goâve's residents were living in fear about access to medicine, water and food in the coming days given the political instability in Haiti.\n\n\"We don't know what will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nFor now, neighbors are helping one another source necessities and find places to sleep. Saint-Vil is hosting a number of friends who lost their homes in his small apartment.\n\n\"What I can do, I will do it, but it's not easy because the situation is really complicated for everyone,\" he said.\n\nCuba rides out the storm\n\nPeople in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier.\n\n\"Life is what matters,\" Alexis Ramos, a 54-year-old fisherman, said as he surveyed his destroyed home and shielded himself from the intermittent rain with a yellow raincoat. \"Repairing this costs money, a lot of money.\"\n\nLocal media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground.\n\n\"As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery.

The hurricane was centered about 65 miles (100 kilometers) east of the central Bahamas and about 860 miles (1,385 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda.\n\nAuthorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago's southeast corner ahead of Melissa's arrival.\n\nMelissa's center is forecast to move through southeastern Bahamas later Wednesday, generating up to 7 feet (2 meters) of storm surge in the area. By late Thursday, Melissa is expected to pass just west of Bermuda."

The military says it was dismantling a Hamas tunnel in an area of Gaza where Israeli troops were stationed when militants opened fire, killing a soldier. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered immediate \"forceful strikes\" in Gaza. Gaza Civil Defense reports that the strikes killed about 100 Palestinians, including around 35 children. Israel says it killed 30 militants in the strikes.\n\n\n\n🎧 The strikes were one of the single deadliest 24-hour periods in Gaza, even deadlier than some of the days of war, according to NPR's Daniel Estrin. The ceasefire was back on as of 10 a.m. local time today in Israel. The dispute over the search for Israeli hostage bodies that remain in Gaza threatens to impact the fragile ceasefire. Israel has been considering limiting aid to Gaza to pressure Hamas to hand over the bodies more quickly.\n\nAir traffic controllers say working without pay this week due to the government shutdown is making a difficult job even harder.

Though these workers are in the minority, it is adding stress to controllers. There have been isolated delays seen at U.S. airports due to staffing shortages, but overall these delays are generally in line with what's normal outside of the shutdown, NPR's Joel Rose says. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said yesterday that while many air traffic controllers can make it without their first paycheck, nearly all of them cannot manage without two.

The data indicate that GLP-1 weight loss drugs are having an impact. The number of Americans using injectable obesity treatments has doubled over the past year and a half. GLP-1 agonists, as the new treatments are known, were first approved for obesity treatment in the U.S. in 2021. Here's what is known about how the drugs' usage is bringing down the U.S. obesity rate:\n\n\n\n💪 Since the drugs have been introduced to the market, obesity rates have declined significantly among people between ages 40 and 64. This correlates with a higher reliance on GLP-1 medications.\n\n💪 The drugs have been a game-changer for patients with obesity, but access to them has been limited and is likely to become a bigger issue. Many private insurers are halting coverage for GLP-1 medications next year, which will make them a costly option for weight maintenance.\n\n💪 Drugmakers are working on bringing potentially less-expensive pill options to the market, but it still might not be the fix needed to make it more accessible for many people.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRead more about what the survey discovered.\n\nLife advice\n\nKristen Uroda for NPR\n\nWhen someone you know has cancer, it can be challenging to figure out how to support them effectively. One of the best ways to be present for your loved one is by considering what you are good at and how you can help them in their time of need. Life Kit has compiled a list of roles that friends and family members can take on to help someone with cancer. Each role addresses a critical need that a cancer patient may have.\n\n\n\n❤️ If you are organized and detail-oriented, you could be a good doctor's appointment buddy. This role is also good for someone with a medical background. This person could have a prepared list of questions, take the lead during appointments.\n\n❤️ If you are comfortable with physical touch, don't mind sitting in silence or possibly have a good comedy routine, you could make a great procedure pal and patient advocate. You can go with your loved one to their scans, surgeries and radiation and chemotherapy appointments. This role focuses less on asking questions and more on providing emotional and physical support.\n\n❤️ If you are good at planning and willing to take initiative, you could be a great household helper and meal planner. Try offering to bring over dinner or coordinating with friends who can help with different activities. Instead of asking, offer to do a specific task like laundry.\n\nFor tips on how to support a loved one through cancer treatment, listen to this episode of NPR's Life Kit.

It also estimated that heat exposure in 2024 resulted in the loss of 247 billion potential labour hours, mostly in the agriculture and construction sectors. amounting to an economic loss of about $194bn (£151bn). While heatwaves are not new to India, their frequency and intensity have been rising steadily over the past few decades because of global warming.\n\nProlonged exposure to extreme heat has serious repercussions on health. It can overwhelm the body's ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of dehydration, heatstroke, cardiovascular stress, and even death - particularly among the elderly, infants and outdoor workers. And the 2025 Lancet Countdown report - which tracks the health impact of climate change and is widely regarded as a key scientific reference on the issue - warns that the health risks posed by rising global temperatures are now more severe than ever. \"Throughout last year,152 record-breaking extreme weather events were registered across 61 countries, and life-threatening, extreme heat events are becoming more intense than previously predicted,\" the report stated. \"The climate crisis is a health crisis. Every fraction of a degree of warming costs lives and livelihoods,\" said Jeremy Farrar, assistant director-general for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care at the World Health Organization (WHO). The report found that heat-related mortality has increased by 23% worldwide since the 1990s, with an average of around 546,000 deaths each year.\n\nReuters India is among the most polluted countries in the world\n\nIt also found that the average person worldwide was exposed to 16 days of extreme heat last year that would not have occurred without climate change. \"This [report] paints a bleak and undeniable picture of the devastating health harms reaching all corners of the world,\" said Dr Marina Romanello, of University College London, who led the report's analysis. \"The destruction to lives and livelihoods will continue to escalate until we end our fossil fuel addiction,\" she added.\n\nAir Quality"

Jordan Senior\n\nJordan Senior's cabin in Jamaica is now knee-deep in floodwaters after Hurricane Melissa. Jordan Senior\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a Wednesday evening conversation with Jordan Senior, 36, a rental-property owner and operator in Treasure Beach, Jamaica. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified the financial details in this story.\n\nI'm family with most people in Treasure Beach, Jamaica. I've lived here for years, and I work in the hospitality industry, running short-term rentals.\n\nAs a Jamaican local, I'm no stranger to hurricanes. I was here during Hurricane Ivan. I was here for Beryl in 2024. I lost the roof on my home during Beryl.\n\nWe were stressed about Hurricane Melissa. Authorities told us it would be a Category Five hurricane.\n\nThey said, \"We've never had a hurricane like this before. It's going to wreck the place. Prepare, prepare, prepare.\"\n\nWhen it finally arrived, it wasn't the worst I've lived through, but it was rough. I sheltered at home with my wife, and the wind and rain were so strong that we couldn't see anything.\n\nOutside our window, it was all just white — a white spray of water everywhere.\n\nWhen it died down, I took stock of the rental cabin that is my primary source of income. It is just a short distance from my home, and the flooding around it was the worst I've ever seen.\n\nCashaw Cabin\n\nJordan Senior's A-frame cabin in Treasure Beach, before the flooding. Jordan Senior\n\nI built Cashaw Cabin, a one-bedroom A-frame cabin with a private pool five minutes from Treasure Beach, in 2022 and opened it for business in 2023. I invested about $40,000 in the property.\n\nIt has a small kitchenette, a full bathroom, a patio, a back garden, and a plunge pool, and is perfect for two people.\n\nAcross the year, it's booked about 15 to 20 nights a month, but from mid-November to May, it's booked out almost every night.\n\nI rent it for about $115 to $150 per night, depending on the time of the year, on platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, and Expedia. Apart from my photography gig, it's my primary source of income, and I earn around $30,000 yearly from it.\n\nGuests have described it as rustic chic and said they felt like they were on an island by themselves in the cabin.\n\nHurricane damage\n\nJordan Senior's cabin has suffered massive flooding from the hurricane. Jordan Senior\n\nAfter Hurricane Melissa, it looks like it's been submerged in the sea.\n\nThe flooding is up to my knee, and it's impossible to enter the cabin. The landscaping has been wiped clean.\n\nThe water is slowly going down, so I just have to wait and see. But I don't think I will be in a position to reopen it to guests for at least a month and a half, maybe even January.\n\nAirbnb has canceled my bookings. I understand, that's no problem, they have to look after people.\n\nBut at the same time, maybe the host needs some help, too. If you're canceling bookings months after a storm, that doesn't really work out for the hosts because we don't have anything to look forward to in terms of earnings.\n\nI'm trying to get this thing ready so I can host again as soon as possible.\n\nA new property that's set back by months\n\nJordan Senior's new two-bedroom villa has been severely damaged. Jordan Senior\n\nI was using the earnings from Cashaw Cabin to partially fund another construction project, a two-bedroom villa. It was almost ready to start operations. If not for the hurricane, it would have been up in a couple of weeks.\n\nThis villa and two other properties I'm building have cost me about $60,000, which I've funded from my savings and with a family investor.\n\nSenior's new villa was almost ready before the hurricane, which damaged it severely. Jordan Senior\n\nThe unit is largely destroyed. The frame is still there, but the roof is gone, and something hit the wall and smashed it up. So that has to be repaired again, because all the work that's already been done has been annihilated.\n\nThe money I was going to spend on the final touches on the property and its launch will now have to be used for repair work. I'll have to dip even further into my savings now.\n\nPhysically, I'm OK. Mentally, I'm exhausted.\n\nRepresentatives for Airbnb, Booking.com, and Expedia did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAirbnb has a major disruptive events policy that guides how it handles cancellations and refunds. Hurricanes in the Caribbean Sea are in its list of \"most common foreseeable weather events.\" Affected Airbnb hosts in the region can cancel reservations without paying fees, per Airbnb's website.\n\nIn a press release on Wednesday, Airbnb said it would offer free emergency housing for Hurricane Melissa first responders in affected Caribbean countries, including Jamaica."

        "content": "The Caribbean just suffered one of the largest Hurricanes in recorded history. The scale of Melissa — which bombarded Jamaica, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic with sustained winds of 185 mph — is unprecedented, which is makes it all the more bizarre to see fake AI-generated images of the storm go viral.\n\nWhile sharing doctored images in the aftermath of a disaster is a decade-long tradition at this point, Yale’s Climate Connections blog notes that generative AI is now making crisis misinformation worse than it’s ever been.\n\nOne of the most flagrant pieces of disinfo surrounding Hurricane Melissa is an AI generated picture purporting to show the system from miles above the ground. The image shows an absolutely mammoth hurricane eye, punctuated by a flock of birds circling safely above.\n\nYet as retired meteorologist and National Weather Service science and operations office Rich Grumm told Yale’s CC, the scale of the image simply doesn’t work — Melissa’s eye was reported to be around 10 miles wide.\n\n“Based on the scale of the eye, these birds would be larger than football fields,” Grumm told CC.\n\nAnd as former meteorology professor at Penn State University, Lee Grenci told the blog, “these birds would have to have been flying at altitudes well above the summit of Mount Everest” for this image to be real.\n\n“The air temperature and air density are way too low for birds to fly,” Grenci commented. Sure enough, as the fake image was going viral, a daring crew of hurricane hunters demonstrated the physical limits of weather observation flights when they punched through the storm wall and into Melissa’s eye, capturing some jaw dropping footage of the monster system.\n\nAs far as the fake image goes, it seems to have kicked off on X-formerly-Twitter at around 1am EST on October 28, but soon began making the rounds all over Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Meta’s Threads, earning tens of thousands of reactions. With dozens of various accounts posting the exact same image, it’s likely the post spread with the help of a coordinated bot farm.\n\n“I’ve never seen the ‘stadium effect’ so pronounced and well-defined,” one poster said on X, uploading the AI image alongside a real one. “This will be in meteorology textbooks.”\n\nYale’s CC notes this isn’t the only piece of AI-misinformation surrounding Hurricane Melissa. Another bit of viral slop appeared to show a Jamaican hospital completely decimated by the storm, though fact checkers quickly identified a SynthID stamp, an invisible watermark embedded into content made with Google’s AI tools.\n\nStill, it’s impossible to tell the harm it might have caused — it’s not hard to imagine scenarios where those seeking help may have been convinced an otherwise still-functioning hospital is completely destroyed.\n\nIt’s yet another example of the dangerous rise in AI-generated misinformation, and a reminder that this is one genie we won’t be putting back into the bottle anytime soon.\n\nMore on AI: Slop Farmer Boasts About How He Uses AI to Flood Social Media With Garbage to Trick Older Women\n\n"

        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The man accused of sparking the deadly wildfire that ripped through a Los Angeles neighborhood in January must remain jailed while he awaits trial, a judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nFederal officials have said Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, started a small fire on New Year’s Day that smoldered underground before reigniting nearly a week later and roaring through coastal Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many of Los Angeles’ rich and famous. The fire, which left 12 dead in the hillside neighborhoods, was one of two blazes that broke out on Jan. 7, killing more than 30 people in all and destroying over 17,000 homes and buildings while burning for days in Los Angeles County.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Rozella A. Oliver denied his bond, saying he must be kept in custody due to his mental health and distress he caused his sister and her family. Rinderknecht’s father testified in support of his release, denying that his son had mental health issues.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRinderknecht was arrested Oct. 7 in Florida, where he staying at his sister’s house. A judge ordered that he remain jailed after a prosecutor said he had traits of an arsonist and his family had worried about his declining mental state. Prosecutors also argued Rinderknecht was a flight risk because he had family in France and spoke French.\n\nHe was brought to Los Angeles about two weeks later and pleaded not guilty in court.\n\nRinderknecht's sister offered him $10,000 to leave her house\n\nProsecutors mentioned two incidents during Rinderknecht's time in Florida when his sister and her husband called 911 because they were concerned about his behavior.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I’m afraid that when he’s triggered ... he might actually use his gun,” his father told law enforcement in body camera footage.\n\nOne time, Rinderknecht got into an argument with his sister after finding out she had cancer, telling her that she should become vegan.\n\nHe also told her he would burn her house down.\n\nLess than a week later, Rinderknecht had an argument with his father, who was visiting from France, and told him that he had purchased a gun. He said he bought it because his relationship with his sister's husband was worsening and would use if attacked.\n\nHis sister told law enforcement that he was “sensitive and volatile” and they felt like they were “walking on eggshells” around him, especially with young children in the home, Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Alexander said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt one point he told his sister, \"If I wanted to kill you guys I could’ve done that a long time ago,\" his sister said in body camera footage. She called him angry, paranoid, and delusional.\n\nRinderknecht's sister and her husband offered to pay for his move back to California and give him $10,000 if he left their home voluntarily, but he refused unless they gave him $25,000, Alexander said. His sister and her husband moved out instead.\n\n“I don't want to be in the house with my kids with him and a gun,” his sister said in body camera footage.\n\nDespite these incidents, his father said Rinderknecht's sister and her husband were willing to have him back in their Florida home, and put up $100,000 for his bond. His father said he and Rinderknecht's mom were willing to move back from France and watch over him.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe family is \"very supportive of him,” his father said. “They are ... upset that Jonathan is being accused of things he hasn't done.”\n\nRinderknecht was indicted on one charge of malicious destruction by means of a fire, one count of arson affecting property used in interstate commerce, and one count of timber set afire. If convicted, he would face up to 20 years in federal prison.\n\nHis trial is scheduled for April 21, 2026.\n\nAttorney blames fire department for not putting out initial blaze\n\nFederal officials called the Palisades blaze a “holdover fire” from the Jan. 1 fire that Rinderknecht is accused of starting, which was not fully extinguished by firefighters. LA’s interim fire chief said such fires linger in root systems and can reach depths of 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 meters), making them undetectable by thermal imaging cameras.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRinderknecht's attorney Steve Haney has said that even if Rinderknecht was the cause of the initial smaller fire on New Year’s Day, there were several “intervening factors” in the week between that day and when the Palisades Fire ignited, mainly the Los Angeles Fire Department's response to the fire.\n\nHaney said after the bond hearing that he's contemplated whether his client can get a fair trial in Southern California or whether it needs to be held elsewhere.\n\n“Jonathan is being scapegoated for governmental failures,” Haney said. “There's no way that the Palisades Fire should have ever happened. It happened because (the LAFD) didn't do their job.”\n\nAccording to text messages obtained by the Los Angeles Times, firefighters mopping up the initial fire were ordered to leave the area even though they complained the ground was still smoldering and rocks remained hot to the touch. Mayor Karen Bass’ new pick for fire chief, Jaime Moore, has promised to commission an outside investigation into the matter.\n\n“We're going to get those text messages,” Haney said."

        "content": "Republican Cory Bowman, half brother of Vice President JD Vance, is challenging Democratic incumbent Aftab Pureval for Cincinnati mayor.\n\nPureval is considered the frontrunner after winning the primary with 83% of the vote compared to Bowman's 13%.\n\nVice President Vance has not been publicly involved in his half-brother's campaign beyond a social media endorsement.\n\nIt's not been a typical mayoral race in Cincinnati.\n\nFirst off, Republicans don't often run for mayor of Cincinnati, a city that has voted 3-to-1 Democratic in recent presidential elections. The last Republican to run for mayor, Brad Wenstrup, lost to Mark Mallory in 2009. It worked out for Wenstrup, though, when he rolled his mayoral campaign into a 12-year congressional career.\n\nThis time around, the Republican candidate for Cincinnati mayor also happens to be Vice President JD Vance's half-brother: Cory Bowman, a pastor at a church in Cincinnati's West End.\n\nDespite, or maybe because of, Bowman's personal relationship to the White House, Bowman faces a steep climb to unseat Democratic incumbent Aftab Pureval.\n\n\"We’ll just say I think a Bowman win would be a political earthquake,\" said Xavier University Political Science Professor Mack Mariani. \"It would be a tsunami, Sharknado, earthquake combination. It’s a very Democratic city, as most urban cities are.\"\n\nEarly voting started Oct. 7. Election Day is Nov. 4.\n\nIs the race competitive?\n\nWhile Bowman survived a three-way mayoral primary in May, he finished a distant second with 13% of the vote, well behind Pureval's 83%. Bowman supporters point to the low turnout in the primary, in which only 10% of registered voters showed up to the polls.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm from political donors on either side. Compared to the previous mayoral election, little has been spent and raised by either candidate. The races are officially nonpartisan but party politics play a big role in the campaigns.\n\nPureval has outraised Bowman so far, raising $311,913 this year compared to Bowman's $56,033 as of the last reports filed in October. Pureval has even garnered the support of prominent Republican donors Carl Lindner III and Martha Lindner. They have given thousands of dollars to Republican causes over the years, including $844,000 each to President Donald Trump.\n\nThey both donated $1,100 to Pureval.\n\nThe campaigns have largely played out online and door-to-door. Bowman and the Republicans running for Cincinnati City Council have campaigned under a \"Flip the 'Nati\" slogan. Pureval's slogan is \"Strength in Unity.\" Democrats control city government, from mayor to all nine City Council members.\n\nPureval said he's out door-knocking most evenings. Does he see the race as competitive?\n\n\"I would refer you to the primary,\" Pureval told The Enquirer, referring to the primary in which he outperformed Bowman by 70 percentage points.\n\n\"I'm out in the community every weekend, most evenings, and the feedback I'm getting is that they're encouraged about the future,\" he said.\n\nBowman said he's got a lean campaign staff of a \"handful of people.\" He declined to name his campaign manager publicly because they've been targeted by threats, he said.\n\n\"We're just keeping it simple, keeping it on door knocking, keeping it on signage, keeping it on just getting our message out to as many people as we can,\" Bowman said.\n\nDark time for Bowman campaign after the primary\n\nRight after the primary, Bowman's campaign went quiet with few public statements or appearances.\n\nBowman told The Enquirer at the time he was regrouping. Behind the scenes Bowman said he knew he faced long odds, he told supporters in September.\n\n\"When we got out of the primary, to be honest with you, based on everything going on, I kind of went in a cave,\" Bowman said at a fundraiser in September in Corryville. \"Because I was like, 'Hey we're making a stand right now. We're going to November, but there's not really a shot of this.'\"\n\nSo in June, Bowman said he found himself behind the counter of his coffee shop he owns across the street from his church in the West End. He said he heard customer after customer, many police officers, voice various complaints about city leadership. That feedback gave his campaign motivation, he said.\n\nCrime brought more attention to the race\n\nThen a brawl broke out on Cincinnati's Fourth Street in the early morning hours of July 26. The videos of people shouting, taking fighting stances and getting pummeled went viral. It hit on issues of race and crime in cities, creating a perfect political storm.\n\nBowman began attackingthe mayor and current administration for being soft on crime and posting about incidents of violent crime downtown. Pureval and the administration responded with videos and press conferences touting the city's efforts to combat crime and touting the city as safe. Crime statistics from the police show overall, crime has dropped across the city over the past three years. Still, property crimes in some areas, including Downtown, have risen.\n\nPureval has touted steps the city has taken, including a stronger curfew, more police recruitment classes, more drones and more visible police patrols.\n\n\"The long-term strategy is recruiting and retaining more police officers so that we have the manpower to increase our visibility throughout the city and also enforce the law,\" Pureval said. \"Those recruit classes are a really big part of that.\"\n\nBowman described a city administration he believes is tying the hands of officers and impeding their ability to apprehend criminals. If elected, he said he'd aim to hold weekly press conferences naming judges who release prisoners too early.\n\n\"Get the judges and the prosecutor to wake up and just say, 'Hey, we need to be a little bit harsher on what's going on in our city,\" Bowman said. \"This whole revolving door of criminals has to stop.\"\n\nTheetge placed on leave\n\nAfter a shooting on Fountain Square Oct. 13 in the heart of the city's downtown, political pressure continued to mount on Pureval's administration. City Manager Sheryl Long put Police Chief Teresa Theetge on paid leave and launched an internal investigation into the effectiveness of her leadership.\n\nPureval has maintained he has not pushed the city manager to take action against Theetge but said he supports the city manager's decision.\n\nBowman has toned down his rhetoric\n\nBowman came out of the gate with a spicy speech at his launch in March. He slammed the city's sanctuary status as an invitation for \"traffickers, cartels and criminals that can't go anywhere else.\" For anyone who inappropriately touches a child, he said, he'll have a \"Glock to nuts policy.\"\n\nSince then, he's omitted \"Glocks\" and \"nuts\" from his campaign speeches in favor of more traditional political fare about crime and other policy.\n\n\"I need you to understand the journey we've been on with this,\" Bowman told his supporters at a September fundraiser. \"Because for me, it wasn't like, 'Oh, here's some political ambitions that I've always had my whole life. Now is my start. No, it's all about impact.\"\n\nVance not involved in brother's campaign\n\nBeyond a post on X the day of the primary urging people to vote for his half-brother, the vice president hasn't been publicly involved in the race. Vance didn't vote in the primary and didn't donate to Bowman's campaign, according to records from the Board of Elections.\n\nBowman said that's true behind the scenes, too. When the pair talk, it's usually about 'Star Wars' and their children, he said.\n\n\"He'll ask how the campaign's doing, and I'll ask him how being vice president is, and it's usually a short talk,\" Bowman said. \"At the end of this, I would rather have a brother than a political advisor.\"\n\nTwo debates held\n\nBowman and Pureval have held two debates since the primary. The first debate on Oct. 9 got spicy. Pureval called Bowman and some of his followers \"MAGA extremists.\" Bowman didn't distance himself from Trump but said the race was about local issues.\n\nPrior to the debate, Pureval had criticized Bowman for not showing up at several high-profile forums Pureval attended.\n\nBowman, when asked by The Enquirer why he didn't show up to the forums, wouldn't say, and pointed the finger back at Pureval.\n\n\"There’s other events I’ve been to in the city he hasn’t attended as well,” Bowman said. Bowman wouldn't specify what those events were.\n\nBowman has a lot of supporters outside the city\n\nIt's not clear where Bowman will find the additional votes in the city to make up the huge gap from the primary. The Enquirer attended several campaign events where many Bowman supporters hailed from the more conservative, Trump-loving suburbs outside the city or elsewhere. A recent fundraiser sponsored by the late Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA featured speakers and people from outside the city, including roofer Garey Faulkner, a competitive beard champion and roofer from Amelia in Clermont County east of Cincinnati.\n\nAt the end of September, Bowman's church hosted a town hall with GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. While city supporters attended, many were like Henry Oberson, 57, of Loveland – a suburbanite who grew more interested in city politics after the street brawl video went viral.\n\nWhile he can't vote in the city election, Oberson said he likes Bowman.\n\n\"I think the momentum is building and changed and the campaign definitely has a very legitimate shot to win,\" Oberson said.\n\nWhat is Bowman's future?\n\nPolitical experts aren't so sure. If Bowman gets 40% of the vote, that would be a feat in an urban area, said Mariani, the Xavier political science professor. He might be able to parlay a strong showing into a congressional run, ala Wenstrup, or some other stab at higher office, Mariani said.\n\nBowman's chances of a better showing go up the lower the turnout, he said.\n\n\"If people don’t show up, you don’t need as many votes,\" Mariani said. \"It’s the longest of longshots.\"\n\nWho is Aftab Pureval?\n\nPureval, 43, a Democrat from Clifton, is running for his second term as mayor. Before winning the mayoral race in 2021, Pureval served as Hamilton County Clerk of Courts.\n\nHe sprang onto the political scene in 2016, unseating incumbent Republican Tracey Winkler for clerk of courts. After defeating a member of a prominent Republican political family, he rode that momentum to a congressional run in 2018 in which he lost to the incumbent Republican Rep. Steve Chabot.\n\nSince becoming mayor, he's garnered some national attention in Politico and the Los Angeles Times. He spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention. While rumors have flown around the city from time to time that Pureval is running for another office, he's always denied that.\n\nWho is Cory Bowman?\n\nBowman, 36, is pastor of The River Church in the West End and is a registered Republican. He also co-owns the Kings Arms Coffee, a West End coffee shop. He lives in College Hill. In a text to The Enquirer, he said he temporarily moved to the West End near his church this year but moved back to College Hill.\n\nBut it's Bowman's family that has drawn much of the attention. His half-brother is Vice President JD Vance.\n\nBowman has never run for office before. He said he's considered a role in local government as a way to give back to the city. Attending Vance and President Donald Trump's inauguration in January further inspired him to run, he told The Enquirer in February."

By early Tuesday afternoon, the death stood at 27, while another 956 people were injured, Public Health Ministry spokesperson Sharafat Zaman said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe tremor also damaged historical sites, including Afghanistan’s famed Blue Mosque in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, which is one of Afghanistan’s most revered religious landmarks, and the Bagh-e-Jahan Nama Palace in Khulm.\n\nThe Blue Mosque's minaret was badly damaged, while some bricks and tiles had fallen from some of the mosque's walls and cracks appeared in other parts of the centuries-old site, said Mahmoodullah Zarar, Head of Information and Culture of Balkh Province.\n\n“The Holy Shrine is a valuable monument of Islamic values ​​and the history of the Islamic era ... (and) is in dire need of repair and restoration,” he said, adding that information on the damage had been shared with the ministry of art and culture.\n\nVideo footage from the mosque, which is a major gathering place during Islamic and cultural festivals, showed structural damage to parts of the mosque, while brickwork and the decorative tiles that adorn its facade had crumbled in several places and laid strewn on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe most severely damaged historical monument in the province was the 19th century Bagh-e Jehan Nama Palace, said Firozuddin Munib, Samangan province’s Head of Information and Culture. The palace, built in 1890-1892, and its adjoining gardens are a popular site for visitors.\n\n“The restoration of this palace is very important because winter is coming and the area is cold, and it is raining, which may cause further damage,” Munib said, adding that the quake caused a surrounding wall and one tower to collapse and also led to cracks in the palace and other towers.\n\nIn Khulm, aftershocks rattled survivors, who spent the night out in the open.\n\n“People are still scared because of last night’s earthquake because small tremors were felt during the day,” said local resident Asadullah Samangani. “We spent the night in the open ground last night, the weather was very cold, we couldn’t sleep, we feel like there will be another earthquake now.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe said authorities had sent tents and basic necessities, but that his home was “completely destroyed, nothing was left intact to use. Our children were all sick in the morning because we had spent the night in the cold, and all the household items were under the rubble.\n\n\"People from other areas came to help, but our belongings are still under rubble and damaged. Our women are facing great difficulties, we do not have a toilet and we do not have a place where our women can spend the night.”\n\nRescue crews were still operating in some areas on Tuesday, and were expected to finish by the end of the day.\n\nThe World Health Organization said partial damage had been reported in several health facilities, while the laboratory at the Samangan Provincial Hospital had collapsed, destroying critical medical equipment. Emergency response operations with health teams and rescue units were ongoing, it said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nImpoverished Afghanistan often faces difficulty in responding to natural disasters, especially in remote regions. Buildings tend to be low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and outlying areas made from mud bricks and wood, many poorly built.\n\nIn August, a quake in eastern Afghanistan killed more than 2,200 people."

Most denied the allegations.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nInterior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said about 320,000 members of the Iglesia Ni Cristo, or Church of Christ, led the start of the three-day rally in Manila's Rizal Park, many wearing white and carrying anti-corruption placards. Hundreds, including retired generals, held a separate anti-corruption protest late Sunday at the \"People Power\" monument in suburban Quezon city.\n\nIglesia is an influential group that votes as a bloc and is courted by political candidates during elections.\n\nThe police, backed by the military, went on full alert and deployed thousands of personnel to secure the weekend rallies, although the government expects them to be peaceful, according to a confidential security assessment seen by The Associated Press.\n\nDuring a Sept. 21 anti-corruption demonstration, a few hundred black-clad protesters threw rocks, bottles and firebombs at police near the presidential palace in Manila, injuring more than 100 officers. Criminal complaints have been filed against 97 protesters.\n\ntoggle caption Mark Cristino/AP\n\nThe presidential palace went on security lockdown over the weekend, with major access roads barricaded by anti-riot police, cargo containers and barbed wires.\n\nNational police chief Lt. Gen. Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. ordered law enforcement to exercise \"maximum tolerance\" in Sunday's rallies.\n\nMarcos promises quick action as outrage over corruption grows\n\nFlood control is an especially sensitive issue in the Philippines, one of Asian countries most prone to deadly typhoons, flooding and extreme weather. Two typhoons left at least 259 dead this month, mostly from flash floods and landslides, and affected millions of others.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been trying to quell public outrage and street protests sparked by the scandal, saying on Thursday that many of the powerful senators, members of Congress and wealthy businesspeople who were implicated would be in jail by Christmas.\n\nMarcos said an independent fact-finding commission he created has already filed criminal complaints for graft and corruption and plunder against 37 suspects. Criminal complaints have also been filed against 86 construction company executives and nine government officials for allegedly evading nearly 9 billion pesos ($152 million) in taxes.\n\nAmong those accused are lawmakers opposed to and allied with Marcos, including former House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president's cousin and a key ally; and former Senate President Chiz Escudero. Both have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSen. Bong Go, a key ally of former President Rodrigo Duterte, has also been accused of involvement in corruption in flood control and other infrastructure projects. He has denied the allegations.\n\nDuterte, a harsh Marcos critic, was detained by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands in March for alleged crimes against humanity over his brutal anti-drugs crackdowns.\n\nHis daughter, the current vice president, said Marcos should also be held accountable and jailed for approving the 2025 national budget, which appropriated billions for flood control projects.\n\nThere have been isolated calls, including by some pro-Duterte supporters, for the military to withdraw support from Marcos, but Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. has repeatedly rejected those calls.\n\n\"With full conviction, I assure the public that the armed forces will not engage in any action that violates the Constitution,\" Brawner said. \"Not today, not tomorrow and certainly not under my watch.\""

(0:44)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nForward Martin Necas will remain with the Colorado Avalanche after signing an eight-year extension, the club announced Thursday.\n\nGetting a new deal done for Necas was a priority with the 26-year-old in the second season of a two-year bridge deal that was worth $6.5 million annually. Necas' new contract, which starts next season, will see him earn $11.5 million annually, a source told ESPN's Emily Kaplan.\n\nThe source also said that Necas will have $60.4 million in signing bonuses while having a full no-trade clause in the first seven years of the deal.\n\nNecas signed his current contract in July 2024 when he was playing with the team that drafted him, the Carolina Hurricanes. He was in his strongest season before the Hurricanes included him in a package in the first of two trades involving Mikko Rantanen last season. A second trade would later see the Hurricanes move Rantanen to the Avs' Central Division rival Dallas Stars.\n\nReceiving Necas in return created the belief that the Avs could use him as Rantanen's replacement as their top-line right winger. Necas' arrival saw him score 11 goals and 28 points in 30 games for the Avs as part of a season that saw him finish with 27 goals and a career-high 83 points.\n\nThis season has seen the 26-year-old continue to build upon what he accomplished last season. His seven goals are second on the Avs while his 13 points are third. Another indication of his importance to the Avs has been the fact that his 21:14 in average ice time is second among Colorado's forwards.\n\nRe-signing Necas now means the Avalanche have nine players who are under contract for more than three years. It's a list that includes Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog, Valeri Nichushkin, Devon Toews, Brock Nelson and Mackenzie Blackwood. Meanwhile, two-time defending Norris Trophy winner Cale Makar has two years left on his current contract.\n\nNecas' contributions have also played a significant role in the Avs coming into Thursday in a five-way tie with the Montreal Canadiens, New Jersey Devils, Pittsburgh Penguins and Utah Mammoth for the most points in the NHL."

It was filed as Camp Mystic has drawn renewed outrage from several victims' families over plans to reopen the 100-year-old camp next summer.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAmong the claims in the lawsuit is that a groundskeeper was directed to spend more than an hour evacuating equipment while girls and counselors in cabins closest to the Guadalupe River were ordered to remain there, even as floodwaters overwhelmed the property.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by the families of five campers and the two counselors who died.\n\n\"These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,\" the lawsuit said. \"The camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins.\"\n\nThe suit also alleges the operators of the camp chose not to make plans to safely evacuate campers, despite state rules requiring such plans, and instead ordered campers and counselors to remain in their cabins as a matter of policy.\n\ntoggle caption Eli Hartman/AP\n\nDefendants named in the lawsuit include Camp Mystic, affiliated entities and its owners, including the estate of camp owner Richard Eastland, who also died in the flooding, and his family members.\n\nA separate lawsuit with similar allegations was filed Monday by the family of Eloise Peck, another Camp Mystic camper who died in the flood. Both lawsuits were filed in Travis County.\n\nTelephone and email messages left Monday with an attorney for Camp Mystic seeking comment on the lawsuit were not immediately returned.\n\nThe campers and counselors were killed when the fast-rising floodwaters roared through a low-lying area of the summer camp before dawn on the Fourth of July. All told, the destructive flooding killed at least 136 people, raising questions about how things went so terribly wrong.\n\nCounty leaders were asleep or out of town. The head of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather beforehand, but it's now unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesperson for the camp's operators said in the immediate aftermath.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe camp, established in 1926, did not evacuate and was hit hard when the river rose from 14 feet (4.2 meters) to 29.5 feet (9 meters) within 60 minutes.\n\nRyan DeWitt, whose daughter Molly DeWitt was one of the campers killed in the flooding, said in a statement that the lawsuit is a step toward helping the family find peace.\n\n\"We trust that through this process, light will be shed on what happened, and our hope is that justice will pave the way for prevention and much-needed safety reform,\" DeWitt said.\n\nThe deaths of the campers and counselors, and the gut-wrenching testimony from their parents to Texas lawmakers, led to a series of new laws designed to prevent similar tragedies in the future."

The wind reading was so high it was off the edge of the graph chart that displays the measurements.\n\n\"I knew it was a potentially historic observation,\" Hazelton told USA TODAY on Nov. 20. \"It was sobering to see it happen right near landfall.\"\n\nOther scientists watching the data flow in had similar reactions to the peak gust, a mix of awe at the power of nature and concern for the havoc it can wreak on people and their communities.\n\nAt least 90 deaths have been blamed on Hurricane Melissa, including 45 in Jamaica, where Melissa struck the island as a Category 5 hurricane on Oct. 28 with winds at the surface of more than 150 mph. Jamaican officials said this week Melissa caused at least $8.8 billion in damages. The storm also claimed lives in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n252 mph? Hurricane scientists see potential record in wind data\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration promptly contacted the atmospheric research center to ask them to confirm the measurement.\n\n\"NOAA looped us in when they saw the high wind speed and asked, 'Are these numbers any good?'\" said Holger Vömel, a senior scientist in the center's dropsonde program.\n\n\"They have pilots and researchers literally putting their lives on the line to get these measurements,\" Vömel stated in a news release. \"They’re the heroes, and it’s a privilege we get to play a role in making sure the measurements they acquire are accurate.\"\n\nThe center's staff ran the gust through a quality control program, checked that the numbers tracked with the laws of physics and typical hurricane behavior. With no gaps in reported measurements, and no other anomalies, the center confirmed the gust surpassed the previous dropsonde record gust of 248 mph, measured during Tyhpoon Megi over the Western Pacific in 2010.\n\nThe dropsondes, dropped through a chute in the hurricane hunter aircraft, gather data at levels that would be unsafe for the airplanes and their human passengers.\n\nThe crew aboard Kermit was deploying a fleet of instruments into the hurricane, where they dropped down through intense winds and rain, also streaming data on pressure, temperature and humidity back to the plane, where it could be transmitted to the hurricane center.\n\nThe 252-mph wind gust was recorded just before the dropsonde plunged into the Caribbean south of Jamaica on the morning of Oct. 28. Melissa, with peak sustained winds of 185 mph, was one of the most intense hurricanes on record in the Atlantic.\n\nBut forecasters at the National Hurricane Center and the models they use \"need to know what is happening near sea level because that’s where people and property are most affected,\" said Terry Hock, an engineer who manages the dropsonde program at the foundation's atmospheric research center. \"The dropsonde gets you information you can’t get any other way and that’s why it’s been around for decades.\"\n\nThe scientists and engineers at NCAR works with other hurricane scientists to continue advancing the technology and tools to analyze the data the dropsondes collect.\n\nInto the eye of a hurricane: How NOAA uses drones penetrate monster storms\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, has written about hurricanes, tornadoes and violent weather for more than 30 years.

But police did not provide further details about the occupants of the plane and did not immediately return messages seeking more details.\n\nCoral Springs-Parkland Fire Department Deputy Chief Mike Moser said emergency crews responded within minutes of a call reporting the crash. Initially, no victims were located during rescue efforts and they shifted to a recovery operation. Moser said no homes were damaged, but crews spotted some debris near the retention pond. Local aerial televised footage showed a broken fence in the backyard of one home bordering the pond where the plane went down.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“There was no actual plane to be seen,” Moser said. “They followed the debris trail to the water.

A powerful Category 5 hurricane, Melissa slammed into Jamaica late last month, leaving a path of destruction.\n\nMoser said police would take over recovery efforts, and federal aviation officials would investigate the cause of the crash.\n\nThe small Beechcraft King Air plane took off from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport at approximately 10:14 a.m., according to a spokesperson for the City of Fort Lauderdale, which owns and operates the airport. The crash occurred soon after takeoff, with Coral Springs police officers and firemen responding at 10:19 a.m., just five minutes later.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration records, the plane was manufactured in 1976. King Air models can seat between seven and 12 people, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.\n\nFederal records showed the registered owner of the plane is listed as International Air Services, a company that markets itself as specializing in providing trust agreements to non-U.S. citizens that enable them to register their aircraft with the FAA. A person who answered the company’s phone Monday afternoon declined to answer questions from a reporter, stating “no comment” and ending the phone call.\n\nThe flight tracking website FlightAware shows the plane made four other trips to or from Jamaica in the past week, traveling between George Town in the Cayman Islands and Montego Bay and Negril in Jamaica, before landing in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. It was not immediately clear who was organizing the trips.\n\nHurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on Oct. 28, tied for the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane in history. The storm also caused devastation in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic and prompted relief organizations to mobilize.\n\nLocal government officials in Jamaica said in the days after the storm that Melissa had ripped the roofs off 120,000 structures, affecting some 90,000 families in the island’s especially hard-hit western region. A week after Melissa's landfall in Jamaica, more than 2,000 people were still reported to be in shelters."
