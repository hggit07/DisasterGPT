The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31mi), about 80km off the coast of the Aomori region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It prompted tsunami warnings which have now been lifted, while waves of 70cm (27in) were seen. Some train services have been suspended and thousands of homes have been left without power as a result. Authorities have also warned that a stronger tremor could occur in the coming days - urging the public to remain on high alert for at least a week, according to local media reports.\n\nEPA A car is stranded on a collapsed road in Tohoku, Northern Japan\n\nAddressing citizens affected by the earthquake, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said: \"Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking.\" Orders were issued for about 90,000 residents to evacuate, according to Reuters news agency. The Aomori prefectural government said around 2,700 homes have been left without power. East Japan Railway has also suspended some services along the north-eastern coast. The Japanese government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre and convened an emergency team, chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara has said. \"We are making every effort to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures, including rescue and relief operations,\" he added. Following the tremors, Japanese electric company Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said. None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency. Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011. That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.\n\nEPA This home in Aomori prefecture was among those affected by the earthquake"

        "content": "Indonesians raise white flags as anger grows over slow flood aid\n\n1 day ago Share Save Kelly Ng , Singapore , Riana Ibrahim , BBC Indonesian, Jakarta and Raja Eben Lumbanrau , BBC Indonesian, Jakarta Share Save\n\nAFP via Getty Images People in Indonesia's Aceh province are raising white flags as a call for international solidarity\n\nFor weeks now, angry and distressed residents in Indonesia's westernmost province have been raising white flags over the state's slow response to a series of deadly floods. Triggered by a rare cyclone in November, the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. \"Does the central government not know [what we're experiencing]? I don't understand,\" a tearful Ismail A Jalil said in front of cameras. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is \"under control\". \"Indonesia is capable of overcoming this disaster,\" he told his cabinet last week. Prabowo has also ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts.\n\nPrabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he won in February 2024 on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over mass food poisonings. In August and September, thousands of Indonesians took to the streets over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Many in Aceh still do not have ready access to clean water, food and electricity\n\nDesperate calls for help\n\nLast Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: \"I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world.\" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. \"The flags do not mean we are giving in. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,\" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, told the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. Survivors have spoken of sickness and starvation. \"How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,\" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring that he welcomes help \"from anyone, anywhere\". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a \"national scale\", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts.\n\nDisaster strikes again\n\nFor some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. Aceh, already ravaged by decades of civil war, was among the hardest-hit. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects. \"Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added. Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods - but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government.\n\nGetty Images Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch"

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck off northern Japan late Monday, injuring 23 people and triggering a tsunami in Pacific coast communities, officials said. Authorities warned of possible aftershocks and an increased risk of a megaquake.\n\nThe Japanese government was still assessing damages from the tsunami and late-evening quake, which struck at about 11:15 p.m. in the Pacific Ocean, around 80 kilometers (50 miles) off the coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan’s main Honshu island.\n\n“I’ve never experienced such a big shaking,” convenience store owner Nobuo Yamada told the public broadcaster NHK in the Aomori prefecture town of Hachinohe, adding that “luckily” power lines were still operating in his area.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA tsunami of up to 70 centimeters (2 feet, 4 inches) was measured in Kuji port in Iwate prefecture, just south of Aomori, and tsunami levels of up to 50 centimeters struck other coastal communities in the region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.\n\nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 23 people were injured, including one seriously. Most of them were hit by falling objects, NHK reported, adding that several people were injured in a hotel in Hachinohe and a man in Tohoku was slightly hurt when his car fell into a hole.\n\nThe meteorological agency reported the quake's magnitude as 7.5, down from its earlier estimate of 7.6. It issued an alert for potential tsunami surges of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in some areas and later downgraded to an advisory.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara urged residents to go to higher ground or seek shelter until advisories were lifted. He said about 800 homes were without electricity, and that the Shinkansen bullet trains and some local lines were suspended in parts of the region.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNuclear power plants in the region were conducting safety checks, Kihara said. The Nuclear Regulation Authority said about 450 liters (118 gallons) of water spilled from a spent fuel cooling area at the Rokkasho fuel reprocessing plant in Aomori, but that its water level remained within the normal range and there was no safety concern.\n\nAbout 480 residents were taking shelter at the Hachinohe Air Base, and 18 defense helicopters were mobilized for a damage assessment, Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said.\n\nAbout 200 passengers were stranded for the night at New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido, NHK reported.\n\nThe meteorological agency issued a caution about possible aftershocks in the coming days. It said there is a slight increase in risk of a magnitude 8-level quake and possible tsunami occurring along Japan's northeastern coast from Chiba, just east of Tokyo, to Hokkaido. The agency urged residents in 182 municipalities in the area to monitor their emergency preparedness in the coming week.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSatoshi Kato, a vice principal of a public high school in Hachinohe, told NHK that he was at home when the quake struck, and that glasses and bowls fell and smashed into shards on the floor.\n\nKato said he drove to the school because it was designated an evacuation center, and on the way he encountered traffic jams and car accidents as panicked people tried to flee. Nobody had yet come to the school to take shelter, he said.\n\nPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in brief comments to reporters that the government set up an emergency task force to urgently assess the extent of damage. “We are putting people’s lives first and doing everything we can,” she said.\n\nLater, she urged residents in the region to pay attention to the latest information from local municipalities. “Please be prepared so you can immediately evacuate as soon as you feel a tremor.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe quake struck about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Hachinohe, and about 50 kilometers (30 miles) below the sea surface, the meteorological agency said.\n\nIt was just north of the Japanese coast that suffered the magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in 2011 that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.\n\n“You need to prepare, assuming that a disaster like that could happen again,\" the meteorological agency's earthquake and volcano division official Satoshi Harada said.\n\nAt 6:20 a.m. on Tuesday morning, authorities lifted all tsunami advisories for the Pacific coastline in northern Japan, NHK said.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey reported another earthquake, with a magnitude 5.1, early on Tuesday, about 122 kilometers (76 miles) south of Honcho, at a depth of 35 kilometers.

The tremor, which struck shortly after 23:23, was felt across Lancashire and the southern Lake District, including the towns of Kendal and Ulverston, within 12 miles (19 km) of the epicentre which is believed to be Silverdale in Lancashire. Nikki Maddox, who runs the Blossom Bird coffee shop in Silverdale said she thought her roof was caving in when the tremors started. \"I had just climbed into bed and I heard this enormous rumble. It shook the whole house, it was very, very terrifying,\" she said.\n\nNikki Maddox, who runs the Blossom Bird coffee shop in Silverdale, said she was going to open as usual following the earthquake\n\nMs Maddox, who lives above the shop with her son, said the earthquake lasted about 20 seconds and the noise was \"deafening\". \"It lasted long enough for me to think 'oh no, the roof is caving in this is going to be expensive,' she said. \"We're about two floors up and the movement and the noise that came from the ground up was incredible, it was terrifying. \"It was deafening, my bed is against the wall and I could feel the wall shaking.\"\n\nSilverdale Parish Councillor Liz Unsworth said she had just returned from the village pantomime when the earthquake hit\n\nSilverdale Parish Councillor Liz Unsworth said it felt like her house was \"disintegrating\" around her. \"It was really scary,\" she said. \"I was relaxing before going to bed and I suddenly felt like my roof was falling in, the house was shaking. \"All my neighbours were outside, we didn't know what it was [at the time].\"\n\n'Hell of a scare'\n\nKatrina Simmons, who lives in Carnforth, 4.8 miles (7.7km) from the suspected epicentre, said she was woken in the night by the tremors. \"The shaking woke me up, I thought someone had driven into the house,\" she said. \"It was about 25 to 12 and I jumped straight out of bed. I live on my own so it gave me a hell of a scare,\" the Spar shop assistant added. \"It was only when I went on Facebook this morning I realised it was an earthquake. \"A customer this morning said all the emergency services were on standby at Aldi, at that time they thought it might have been an explosion. Someone said they could hear a helicopter circling.\" The quake occurred just off the coast of Silverdale at a depth of 1.86 miles, data suggested. There were no immediate reports of damage. Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said \"many residents felt or heard a loud bang\" in the area of Carnforth. Lancaster police also said it had received reports of a \"loud explosion\" in the area.\n\nTremors were felt within 12 miles of the epicentre which is believed to be Silverdale in Lancashire\n\nMs Simmons' colleague, Clare Hailes, from North Lancaster, said the force of the tremor set the shop's alarm off. \"I know the general manager got a call in the middle of the night because it set the alarms off,\" she said. \"Customers have been talking about it all morning. They thought a lorry had crashed into a building or there had been a quarry explosion. No-one was expecting it to be an earthquake.\" Lancashire Police said there had been a \"minor earthquake in the area, near to the Lancashire and Cumbria border, measuring 3.3 magnitude\". It added: \"There have been no reports of anyone injured or damage caused but we have officers in the area, together with colleagues from the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service and the North West Ambulance Service.\" The Volcano Discovery website said it had received more than 1,000 reports about the earthquake, with some as far away as Blackpool. One Carnforth resident posted on the site: \"Heard a rumbling sound which intensified in to a loud bang. Thought my roof was collapsing or something! Very scary.\" Another, in Silverdale, posted: \"Loud rumble and rattling of fixtures in house, as though something had collapsed or the chimney had fallen off. Significant enough to go outside to check.\" BGS detects about 300 earthquakes every year in the UK, but only about a tenth of these are felt or heard by people."

        "content": "Japan issued a megaquake advisory Tuesday after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the northern part of the country, causing 34 mostly mild injuries and some damage to roads and buildings. The government has estimated that an offshore megaquake could cause a tsunami of up to 98 feet and kill nearly 200,000 people.\n\nOfficials said the advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%. But there's hope the advisory will serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the 2011 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.\n\nThere's said to be an increased risk of a subsequent, magnitude 8 or larger quake within the next week. Officials are urging residents, especially along coastal areas, to be well prepared so they can grab an emergency bag and run as soon as possible if a bigger quake hits.\n\nThis advisory seemed mindful compared with another advisory last year. The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \"Nankai Trough\" megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.\n\nJapan megaquake advisory follows powerful earthquake\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said Monday's powerful earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido.\n\nA map shows the location and shake intensity of a 7.5 magnitude quake in northern Japan on Dec. 8, 2025. John Saeki and Nicholas Shearman/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDaiki Shimohata, 33, a civil servant in Hashikami on Honshu island, told Agence France-Presse that he and his family rushed outside their home.\n\n\"The tremor was something that we've never experienced. It lasted maybe for about 20 seconds,\" Shimohata said by phone.\n\n\"We were holding our children — a 2-year-old girl and a 1-year-old boy — in our arms. The shaking reminded me of the disaster (in 2011),\" he said.\n\nThe quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches — the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench — that have caused many large quakes in the past.\n\nA vehicle rests on the edge of a collapsed road in Tohoku town in Aomori Prefecture on Dec. 9, 2025, following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake off northern Japan. Jiji Press/AFP via Getty Images\n\nExperts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.\n\nIn explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.\n\nThe 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 50 feet in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.\n\nMegaquake could cause 98-foot tsunami and kill nearly 200,000\n\nAnother offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 98-foot tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.\n\nThe areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba Prefecture.\n\nJapan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.\n\nIn a 2013 damage estimate for a possible Nankai Trough megaquake, the government said a magnitude 9.1 quake could generate a tsunami exceeding 33 feet within minutes, killing as many as 323,000 people, destroying more than 2 million buildings and causing economic damage exceeding 200 trillion yen ($1.28 trillion) in the region.\n\nOfficials call on people to be calm and prepared\n\nOfficials are stressing that the latest advisory has no prediction for any megaquake happening at any specific time or location, a Cabinet official for disaster prevention, Tsukasa Morikubo, told a news conference early Tuesday. He called on residents to be cautious and prepared while continuing their daily activity and work.\n\nOfficials urge people to keep an emergency bag containing a few days' worth of daily necessities along with shoes and helmets. People in the region are also advised to discuss evacuation procedures with family members and sleep in day clothes, not in pajamas, so they can flee immediately. Furniture should also be fixed to the floor or the wall.\n\nThe designated municipalities explained the advisory on their websites and started inspecting stocks of relief goods and equipment to be used at evacuation centers.\n\nIwaki City in Fukushima urged residents to register for emergency emails, while officials in the town of Oarai in Ibaraki Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, inspected wireless communication devices.\n\nJapan's first megaquake advisory in August of last year contained a lot of scientific jargon. It worried and baffled many across the country. Some towns closed beaches and canceled annual events, disappointing many travelers during Japan's Buddhist holidays.\n\nMany people postponed planned trips and rushed to stock up on rice, dried noodles, bottled water and portable toilets, leaving shelves empty at many supermarkets in western Japan and even Tokyo, which is outside of the at-risk area."

More than 800,000 Gazans are at risk from flooding, the UN says.\n\nGhadir al-Adham is longing to move her children into a solid home\n\nSticking point\n\nPlans for new homes - and new government - lie frozen in the next stage of US President Donald Trump's peace deal, as the search continues for Israel's last missing hostage, Ran Gvili. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has insisted Hamas must return all Israel's hostages – living and dead – before the two sides move on to the next, more difficult, stage of the peace deal. But several searches of Gaza's rubble have so far shown no sign of him. Mr Gvili was captured during the 7 October Hamas attacks - a police officer, recovering from a broken shoulder, who went to defend nearby kibbutz Alumim.\n\nHandout Yellow flags have been hung for Ran Gvili near his home in southern Israel\n\nHis parents, Talik and Itzik, were told last year he had not survived. The road to their home in Meitar, in southern Israel, is lined with banners paying tribute to him, the yellow flags of remembrance for Israel's hostages fluttering alongside. \"They stole our kid, they stole him,\" his mother Talik told me. \"They know where he is,\" Itzik said. \"They just try to hide or keep him. They're play[ing] with us.\" They believe Hamas wants to keep their son as an insurance policy against future negotiations, after returning all the other hostages, both living and dead.\n\nItzik Gvili (right) accuses Hamas of trying to hide his son\n\nIn response, a Hamas official told the BBC their allegations were untrue, and that Israel was trying to avoid implementing the agreement. But with no sign of Ran's body, and pressure from Washington growing, his parents say they are counting on Israel's leaders not to move forward before their son is found. \"Everyone in Israel['s] government says to us, 'No, we don't move to the second level until Ran comes back.' This is their promise,\" Talik said. Many in Israel believe it would be politically difficult for Netanyahu to carry out the next steps in the deal, including withdrawing Israeli forces further back towards Gaza's perimeter, if even one hostage is still missing in Gaza.\n\nTime 'running out'\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas face difficult concessions in the next stage of the deal. For Hamas, it means handing over weapons and power. For Israel, handing over security to an international stabilisation force. And this is also why leaders on both sides may be hesitating, says retired General Israel Ziv, a former head of Israel's military Operations Directorate. \"Israel and Hamas are sharing the same interests not to move so fast into the second stage,\" he told me. \"Hamas doesn't want to lose control, and the Israeli side for political reasons also prefer to stay in Gaza, as nobody wants to explain to their base that they have to withdraw.\" He says Trump is the only one who can force the two sides forward, and that time is running out.\n\n\"By waiting I think we might miss the opportunity because Hamas is reorganising and [its] strength is coming back,\" he explained. \"We have to take a deep breath and go forward with that plan, because staying in the situation as it is, it's the worst-case scenario.\" Disarming Hamas – in a way both sides will accept – is seen as the first major hurdle. Without that, no foreign countries are likely to commit troops to secure the Strip, and no reconstruction is likely to begin in Hamas-controlled areas. Earlier this week, Netanyahu suggested he was sceptical that foreign nations could complete the task in place of Israel. \"Our friends in America want to try to establish an international force that will do the job,\" he said. \"We know that there are certain tasks that this force can do. I don't want to go into detail, they can't do everything, and maybe they can't do the main thing, but we'll see.\"\n\nTrump eager to move fast\n\nGaza is currently divided in two by the \"yellow line\" marking the limits of Israeli forces under the first stage of the ceasefire deal.\n\nIsrael's military chief of staff recently referred to it as a \"new border line\", sparking accusations that Israel was signalling an intention to remain there long term. Key issues, including how to disarm Hamas, are due to be discussed at a meeting between Netanyahu and Trump in Florida later this month. The US president – who has already brokered a ceasefire in Gaza and pushed his peace plan through the UN Security Council – has been outspoken about his desire to move the process forward. He told journalists this week that he would announce the membership of a newly created Board of Peace for Gaza early next year. \"It will be one of the most legendary boards ever… Everybody wants to be on it,\" he said.\n\nGetty Images The floods make it hard for Gazans to keep children dry"

        "content": "Dec. 1, 2025, 2:04 p.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary Multiple small wildfires broke out across the Florida panhandle amid ongoing drought conditions.\n\nMost of the fires are largely contained, though the region remains under various levels of drought.\n\nSeveral counties, including Bay and Washington, are under a burn ban due to the dry conditions.\n\nPANAMA CITY — Multiple fires broke out across the Florida panhandle over the last weekend of November amid ongoing drought conditions.\n\nThe Florida Forest Service maintains a public viewer of active wildfires. Here's a county-by-county breakdown of ongoing fires in the region as of Dec. 1:\n\nBay County\n\nBrandon Road Fire, 100% contained to five acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nCalhoun County\n\nShuman Ferry Road Fire, 75% contained at 10 acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nJackson County\n\nPond Lane Fire, 75% contained at 3.5 acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nAvery Road Fire, 100% contained at seven acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nWashington County\n\nRock Hill Church Road Fire, 75% contained at 6.5 acres as of Dec. 1.\n\nHolmes County\n\nHighway 179 Fire, 80% contained at six acres as of Dec. 1.\n\nOkaloosa County\n\nR40 Fire, 0% contained at five acres as of Nov. 30.\n\nSanta Rosa County\n\nHosea Gillman Road Fire, 95% contained at 1.5 acres as of Nov. 29.\n\nJimmy Ates Road Fire, 95% contained at 1.5 acres as of Nov. 29.\n\nDavis Road Fire, 0% contained at 0.75 acres as of Nov. 29.\n\nSome areas in 'exceptional drought' condition\n\nThe fires come as dry conditions have plunged the entire panhandle into drought. The worst conditions are around the state line with Georgia, where the area is within the most severe drought category: \"Exceptional Drought.\"\n\nMost of the eastern half of the panhandle and the Big Bend are a step down from the worst, sitting in \"extreme drought\" conditions, as of the Nov. 26 U.S. Drought Monitor update. Conditions aren't as bad west of Bay County, with most of Okaloosa and Walton counties in \"severe drought\" conditions.\n\nThe Pensacola area hasn't fared as badly, with parts of the metro within the \"abnormally dry\" to \"none\" categories.\n\nIn the panhandle, Bay, Washington, Calhoun, and Liberty Counties are under a burn ban. As far as fire danger at the time of publication, Dec. 1, the FFS has marked fire danger across the panhandle as \"low.\" Some beneficial, but not drought-busting, rain swept across the region over the Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nWhen will we see rain?\n\nThe National Weather Service's Tallahassee forecasting office said in a Facebook post that more rain is expected at the beginning of the week of Dec. 1, and there's a moderate chance of more rainfall toward the end of the week. Anticipated rainfall is expected to be helpful, but it won't end the drought.\n\nKeetch-Byram Drought Index values, essentially how dry the ground is, are still relatively high around the panhandle. Bay County had a KBDI of 635 on Dec. 1, indicating that it would take 6.35 inches of widespread rainfall to bring the soil back to a saturated condition. Early week showers are only expected to bring up to 1.5 inches of rainfall to Panama City, according to the NWS.\n\nStreamflows remain below normal at Econfina Creek, the Choctawhatchee River and the Chipola River, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. The seasonal forecast from the Climate Prediction Center shows drought persisting but improving for Bay and Washington counties, along with much of the Eastern panhandle and Big Bend.\n\nPossibility of severe weather Dec. 1 and 2\n\nMeanwhile, there's a marginal risk of severe weather for the night of Dec. 1 and the morning of Dec. 2.\n\n\"There is a marginal risk of severe thunderstorms late tonight through early Tuesday morning for portions of the Florida panhandle, mainly near the coast,\" wrote a NWS meteorologist in our area's forecast discussion. \"A tornado or two is possible in this area along with gusty winds.\"\n\nBehind the severe weather threat on Dec. 2, temperatures are expected to chill off for the next seven days. A low of 36 is forecasted for the evening of Dec. 2, after which lows are anticipated to stay in the 40s.\n\nMore on drought conditions: Burn ban enacted amid severe drought in Bay County\n\nIn better news, Hurricane Season is officially over, and the Gulf Coast made it out unscathed. No further tropical development is expected."

        "content": "Since 2020, scientists have installed monitoring instruments around the Barry Landslide in Alaska's Prince William Sound to closely track seismic activity in the area. Their goal is to detect warning signs early, before a sudden landslide could trigger a destructive tsunami.\n\nBy analyzing these seismic recordings, researchers identified a previously unrecognized type of signal. These events are marked by sharp, high-frequency pulses that become more common from late summer through mid-winter, then suddenly stop in late winter or early spring.\n\nStrange Signals Linked to Freezing and Thawing Rock\n\nWriting in Seismological Research Letters, Gabrielle Davy of the University of Alaska Fairbanks and her colleagues propose that the signals are caused by water freezing and thawing inside tiny cracks in the rock beneath the nearby Cascade Glacier. The research team is the first to carry out a systematic analysis of these short, impulsive seismic events near the Barry Landslide.\n\nThe scientists emphasize that these signals are not signs that the landslide itself is moving. However, they may still provide valuable insight into changes in underground water conditions behind the slope. Those changes could eventually play a role in triggering slope movement.\n\nWhy the Barry Landslide Poses a Serious Risk\n\nSearching for seismic warning signs at Barry Arm is especially important because the landslide sits in a highly unstable setting. The slope is steep and underlain by weak, heavily fractured bedrock, making it prone to failure. It has also lost critical support from Barry Glacier, which has rapidly melted and retreated over the last century.\n\n\"What makes Barry Landslide especially concerning is the size of the landslide,\" Davy explained. \"It's a large, slowly moving mass -- on the order of about 500 million cubic meters -- that has been creeping for decades.\"\n\n\"If a rapid collapse were to occur, the material would fall directly into the fjord, and that could generate a tsunami with potentially high wave heights,\" she added. \"Barry Arm is visited by kayakers and cruise ships, and nearby communities such as Whittier could be affected, so understanding the hazard is important from both a scientific and a public-safety perspective.\"\n\nSorting Through a Year of Seismic Data\n\nBecause of these risks, the landslide area has been extensively instrumented since 2020. The study by Davy and her colleagues is among the first to carefully examine the large volume of seismic data collected by those instruments.\n\nFor this research, the team manually reviewed an entire year of continuous seismic waveform recordings. They searched for signals that might help determine when and where a landslide could occur.\n\nThis hands-on approach allowed the researchers to recognize the wide range of signals present in the data. These included vibrations from small earthquakes, glacier motion, slope deformation, and other sources of seismic background noise.\n\n\"We needed to build a clear baseline understanding of the types of signals that routinely occur in the area, so that any unusual or previously unrecognized signals would stand out. By spending time with the raw data, you train your eye to recognize what 'normal' looks like\" before developing classification tools and detection algorithms, Davy explained.\n\nSeasonal Patterns Reveal a Freeze-Thaw Process\n\nAfter learning how to identify the unusual short-impulsive events in the seismic records, the researchers compared them with weather and rainfall data. They also used ground-based radar to track subtle changes in slope movement. This combination allowed them to study when and where the signals occurred.\n\nThe timing, location, and characteristics of the signals pointed to small, brittle events that happen seasonally as water freezes and thaws inside cracks in the rock.\n\n\"Similar seismic signals have been documented in other settings, although they are not widely reported,\" Davy said. She pointed to a recent study from Norway that observed comparable signals near an unstable rock slope and \"suggested that their signals may be linked to freeze-thaw processes acting on cracks within the bedrock.\"\n\nToward Better Landslide Early Warning Systems\n\nCo-author Ezgi Karasözen said the Alaska Earthquake Center is now testing a regional landslide detection system at the Barry Landslide site. According to Karasözen, the system \"will alert us to any slope failures in this area.\"\n\n\"As research on landslide seismology grows, there's increasing recognition that precursor seismic activity -- when it does occur -- can be an important source of early warning,\" Karasözen said. \"That motivates broader investigations not only at Barry Arm, but also at other sites in southern Alaska where similar hazards exist.\""

The second, a 7.6 mega-quake, hit northern Japan on Dec. 8, prompting tsunami warnings that were later lifted and causing at least 30 injuries. Tens of thousands evacuated their homes.\n\nAftershocks have been recorded for both earthquakes. On Dec. 8, Japanese authorities warned an even more powerful earthquake could strike within the next week and called on residents from the northernmost island of Hokkaido down to Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, to be on high alert.\n\nThe earthquakes were notable for their strength.\n\nIn an average year, the U.S. Geological Survey says about 16 major earthquakes are expected around the world, including 15 with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher and one 8.0 or higher. That's based on records dating back to about 1900. For the last four to five decades, the long-term average number of major quakes in a year has been surpassed about a dozen times.\n\nBut having two such quakes in a short period of time happens from time-to-time and doesn't necessarily signal another impending disaster.\n\n\"It's not all the time, but it's not that crazy,\" said Brandon Schmandt, professor at Rice University and seismology expert.\n\nIt's a reminder of an uncomfortable truth in earthquake science: Scientists know disastrous earthquakes are looming, but have no reliable way to predict when they will hit.\n\n\"No one can predict earthquakes. However, by investigating faults and past quakes, scientists can better assess the likelihood of future earthquakes and how intense their shaking might be,\" the USGS said.\n\nHow strange is it for two big earthquakes to hit?\n\nBy \"pure random chance,\" it's actually not uncommon for two quakes with 7.0 or higher magnitudes to hit this close together in time, according to CalTech seismologist Lucy Jones.\n\n\"We average about one magnitude-7.0 per month somewhere in the world,\" Jones said.\n\nThe average of one per month is randomly distributed, Jones said. We might go several months without one, and then see multiple within a close span. Jones said she would estimate based on probabilities that paired magnitude-7 or higher earthquakes are likely to come within half a week of each other once every few years.\n\n\"It's not like it happens all the time, but we've looked for and can't find any physical correlation,\" she said.\n\nOne earthquake can trigger another, as in an aftershock, but that's not the relationship between the Alaska and Japan quakes, which appear to be wholly unrelated, Schmandt said. Aftershocks tend to happen in the same geographic area as the main earthquake.\n\nJones said there is about a 5% chance after any earthquake that another one will follow nearby within a few days that is bigger in magnitude. Though a 5% chance might not seem like much, it's a much greater than the baseline chances, and it's what's driving Japanese authorities to stay on high alert for the time being, she said.\n\nA recent example happened in 2019 near Ridgecrest, California, Jones noted. A 6.4-magnitude hit on the Fourth of July, and less intense aftershocks followed. Then, one day later, a 7.1 quake became the largest to strike Southern California in 20 years.\n\nIs the US in danger of devastating earthquakes? What about 'the Big One?'\n\nMost of the United States is at risk for damaging earthquake shaking within the next century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which published a report last year that found hundreds of previously unidentified faults around the country.\n\nPeople in 37 states have experienced earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.0 or greater in the last two centuries, according to the USGS.\n\nThe danger is most concentrated along the West Coast and the southern part of Alaska, where the most active tectonic plate boundaries are found.\n\nConcerns of a so-called \"Big One\" event, a massive quake bringing untold devastation, have long rattled residents in these areas. It could happen at any time, or not for a long time, experts say. And there could be more than one \"Big One.\"\n\nSchmandt said the Cascadia Subduction Zone that stretches from Northern California up through Oregon and Washington and into Canada has the potential for a lurking event that could be considered \"the Big One.\" The last known quake in this fault happened in January 1700, with an estimated 9.0 magnitude, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management.\n\n\"Currently, scientists are predicting that there is about a 37% chance that a megathrust earthquake of 7.1+ magnitude in this fault zone will occur in the next 50 years. This event will be felt throughout the Pacific Northwest,\" the department said.\n\nWhat do earthquake magnitudes mean?\n\nAccording to Michigan Technological University, earthquake magnitudes can have the following effects:\n\nBelow 2.5: Generally not felt\n\nGenerally not felt 2.5 to 5.4: Minor or no damage\n\nMinor or no damage 5.5 to 6.0: Slight damage to buildings\n\nSlight damage to buildings 6.1 to 6.9: Serious damage\n\nSerious damage 7.0 to 7.9: Major earthquake. Serious damage\n\nMajor earthquake. Serious damage 8.0 or greater: Massive damage, can destroy communities\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise and Terry Collins, USA TODAY; Reuters"

Heavy rain is expected first over the Santa Barbara area before moving to the Los Angeles area around midnight.\n\nThe rain over Los Angeles could continue until as late as 6 p.m. Wednesday, equating to 18 hours of moderate to heavy rain over the region on Christmas Eve.\n\nABC News\n\nRainfall rates may exceed 1 inch per hour at times, especially at higher elevations.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals over the 18-hour period are expected to reach between 3 inches and 7 inches, but some localized spots could see 9 inches or more.\n\nThe month of December typically brings around 2 to 3 inches of rain to the region, on average, records show.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center issued a rare “High Risk” (level 4 of 4) for excessive rainfall and flash flooding on Wednesday across portions of Southern California. This includes portions of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, and San Bernardino counties.\n\nThe \"High Risk\" includes Los Angeles, Burbank, Altadena, Glendale, San Bernardino, Santa Clarita, and Thousand Oaks.\n\nBeing under a “High Risk” is a rare occurrence. This risk is only issued about 4% of days, accounting for one-third of all flood-related fatalities and 80% of all flood-related damages, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center has issued a level 4 of 4 risk, a major risk, for excessive rainfall and flooding for Ojai, Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, San Fernando, Glendale, West Hollywood, El Monte, San Bernardino and the Angeles National Forest.\n\nLos Angeles and Ventura counties were devastated by the Palisades and Eaton fires in January.\n\nEvacuation warnings are in effect from Tuesday to Thursday at 11 p.m. for the Palisades, Sunset and Hurst burn scar areas.\n\nIn this Jan. 7, 2025, file photo, firefighters battle the Eaton Fire in strong winds as many homes burn, in Pasadena, Calif.

Los Angeles police were going door-to-door, alerting residents at vulnerable addresses, ABC Los Angeles station KABC reported.\n\nRecent wildfire burn scar areas are especially prone to dangerous, flash flooding and could also trigger debris flows and mudslides. The threshold for triggering flash flooding decreases with burned soil. Lower rainfall totals could still trigger flash flooding and it can unfold very quickly.\n\n\"With as much total rain as what we're expecting, widespread, significant flooding will likely occur in urban and poor drainage areas, especially in and around the higher terrain,\" National Weather Service at Oxnard Meteorologist-In-Charge Ariel Cohen said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon. \"There will almost certainly be numerous rock slides and mudslides, along with areas of severe flooding in urban locations and along freeways, which is why being out on the roads will be exceptionally dangerous.\"\n\nRainfall that would normally be absorbed into the ground, instead remains as runoff and can trigger dangerous and significant flash flooding quickly, especially downstream and downhill from a wildfire burn scar area.\n\nThe National Weather Service highlights that in some instances, burned soil can be as water repellant as pavement, A general rule of thumb is that half an inch of rainfall in less than an hour is sufficient to cause flash flooding in a burn area. The susceptibility to flash flood within the burned area is greatest during the first two years following the fire.\n\nIn recent years, parts of California have been experiencing a shift from major drought stages to an extended period of above-average precipitation, which allowed for abundant vegetation growth.\n\nIn this Feb. 13, 2025, file photo, heavy rains created a mud filled debris flow sending cars down Tanoble Drive onto Mendocino Street in the Eaton fire burn area, in Altadena, Calif. Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images, FILE\n\nHydroclimate whiplash -- the rapid shift between wet and dry conditions -- likely contributed to the severity of the wildfires burning in Southern California, experts say.\n\nFlood impacts include significant and widespread urban roadway flooding, a high risk of major mudslides and rockslides and rapid rises to creeks, streams and rivers, which will likely lead to swiftwater rescues.\n\nResidents should expect major travel delays, cancellations and road closures.\n\nMuch of California also faces strong winds beginning Tuesday night. The winds will be strongest in the higher elevations and mountains.\n\nWhile the dangerous flash flooding threat is centered over southern California, the northern half of the state will face the brunt of the strong winds in the coming days.\n\nHigh wind warnings have been issued for cities such as Sacramento, Redding, Santa Barbara, and Santa Clarita.

        "content": "When a magnitude 8.8 earthquake ripped through the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone on July 29, 2025, it launched a Pacific-wide tsunami – and a rare natural experiment.\n\nNASA and the French space agency’s SWOT satellite happened to pass overhead. The satellite captured the first high-resolution, spaceborne swath of a great subduction-zone tsunami.\n\nInstead of a single neat crest racing across the basin, the image revealed a complicated, braided pattern of energy dispersing and scattering over hundreds of miles. These are details that traditional instruments almost never resolve.\n\nThe results go well beyond a pretty picture. They suggest the physics we use to forecast tsunami hazards – especially the assumption that the largest ocean-crossing waves travel as largely “non-dispersive” packets – need a revision.\n\nSatellites transform tsunami mapping\n\nUntil now, deep-ocean DART buoys have been our best open-ocean sentinels: exquisitely sensitive, but sparse, each giving a time series at a single point.\n\nSWOT maps a 75-mile-wide swath of sea surface height in one pass. This lets scientists see the tsunami’s geometry evolve in both space and time.\n\n“I think of SWOT data as a new pair of glasses,” said study lead author Angel Ruiz-Angulo of the University of Iceland. “Before, with DARTs we could only see the tsunami at specific points in the vastness of the ocean.”\n\n“There have been other satellites before, but they only see a thin line across a tsunami in the best-case scenario. Now, with SWOT, we can capture a swath up to about 120 kilometers (75 miles) wide, with unprecedented high-resolution data of the sea surface.”\n\nFrom eddies to a tsunami\n\nNASA and the French space agency CNES launched SWOT in December 2022 to survey surface water around the world.\n\nRuiz-Angulo and co-author Charly de Marez had been poring over its data for ocean eddies when the Kamchatka event hit.\n\n“We had been analyzing SWOT data for over two years understanding different processes in the ocean like small eddies, never imagining that we would be fortunate enough to capture a tsunami,” noted the researchers.\n\nTsunami behavior breaks rules\n\nClassic teaching holds that big, basin-spanning tsunamis behave as shallow-water waves. Their wavelength dwarfs ocean depth, so they march along without breaking into separate components.\n\nSWOT’s snapshot argues otherwise for this event. “The SWOT data for this event has challenged the idea of big tsunamis being non-dispersive,” said Ruiz-Angulo.\n\nWhen the team ran numerical models that included dispersive effects, the simulated wave field matched the satellite pattern far better than “non-dispersive” runs.\n\nThat matters because dispersion repackages the wave train’s energy as it approaches land. “The main impact that this observation has for tsunami modelers is that we are missing something in the models we used to run,” said Ruiz-Angulo.\n\n“This ‘extra’ variability could represent that the main wave could be modulated by the trailing waves as it approaches some coast. We would need to quantify this excess of dispersive energy and evaluate if it has an impact that was not considered before.”\n\nBlending every clue available\n\nSWOT’s swath told scientists what the wave looked like mid-ocean. DART buoys anchored the timing and amplitude at key points.\n\nTwo gauges didn’t line up with tsunami predictions from earlier seismic and geodetic source models – one recorded the waves earlier than expected, and the other recorded them later.\n\nUsing an inversion that assimilated the DART records, the researchers revised the rupture. It extended farther south and spanned roughly 249 miles (400 kilometers), not the 186 miles (300 kilometers) that many initial models assumed.\n\n“Ever since the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake in Japan, we realized that the tsunami data had really valuable information for constraining shallow slip,” said study co-author Diego Melgar. Folding that information in isn’t yet routine.\n\nAs Melgar argued, this is because the hydrodynamic models needed to model DARTs are very different from the seismic wave propagation ones for modeling the solid Earth data.\n\n“But, as shown here again, it is really important we mix as many types of data as possible.”\n\nOld quakes guide new warnings\n\nThe Kuril–Kamchatka margin has a history of producing ocean-wide tsunamis. A magnitude 9.0 quake in 1952 helped motivate the Pacific’s international alert system, which issued basin-scale warnings during the 2025 event.\n\nSWOT’s pass adds a new kind of evidence to that warning toolbox. With enough luck and coordination, scientists could use similar swaths to validate and improve real-time models.\n\nThis will be especially important if dispersion turns out to shape near-coast impacts more than we thought.\n\n“With some luck, maybe one day results like ours can be used to justify why these satellite observations are needed for real or near-real time forecasting,” Ruiz-Angulo said.\n\nA turning point for tsunami forecasts\n\nThree takeaways emerge. First, high-resolution satellite altimetry can see the internal structure of a tsunami in mid-ocean, not just its presence.\n\nSecond, researchers now argue that dispersion – often downplayed for great events – may shape how energy spreads into leading and trailing waves, which could alter run-up timing and the force on harbor structures.\n\nThird, combining satellite swaths, DART time series, seismic records, and geodetic deformation gives a more faithful picture of the source and its evolution along strike.\n\nFor tsunami modelers and hazard planners, the message is equal parts caution and opportunity.\n\nThe physics now has to catch up with the complexity that SWOT has revealed, and planners need forecasting systems that can merge every available data stream. The waves won’t get any simpler – but our predictions can get a lot sharper.\n\nThe study is published in the journal The Seismic Record.\n\nImage Credit: NOAA\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

        "content": "What does climate change look like? This year's hurricane season is one example\n\ntoggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nThe 2025 hurricane season was a study in contrasts.\n\nIn one way, it felt very quiet in the United States. No storms made landfall in the U.S. for the first time since 2015. And, for about three weeks in the middle of the hurricane season, no storms formed at all in the Atlantic.\n\nAnd yet, the storms that did form were among the most powerful hurricanes ever recorded.\n\n\"The one word I would pick for it is 'unusual',\" says Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. In 2025, the total number of tropical storms and hurricanes, 13, was about average. But a lot of those storms ended up being massive Category 5 behemoths.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We had three Category five hurricanes this year, which is the second most in a single season behind only the super hyperactive 2005 season,\" says Lindsey Long, a meteorologist with the Climate Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The infamous 2005 Atlantic hurricane season included hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. The fact that none of this year's storms made landfall in the U.S. was just luck, Long says.\n\nYears like this one, with an average number of overall storms, but an above-average cohort of very powerful hurricanes, are getting more likely because of climate change.\n\nThat's mainly because global warming is causing ocean temperatures to rise dramatically. Planet-warming pollution — most of which comes from burning oil, gas and coal — traps huge amounts of extra heat in the atmosphere. Most of that extra heat is absorbed by the oceans.\n\nThe part of the Atlantic ocean where hurricanes form has experienced record-breaking heat over the last few years.\n\n\"That water is kind of fuel for hurricanes,\" Long says. \"It helps dictate how intense the storm will be.\"\n\nThat's what happened this year with Hurricane Melissa . The storm moved over abnormally warm water as it gained strength, ultimately making landfall in Jamaica as a devastating Category 5 hurricane in late October. The Atlantic hurricane season extends from June 1 to Nov. 30.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt the same time, wind patterns can break storms apart. Wind shear, which happens when there's a big difference in wind speed high in the atmosphere versus down lower, makes it difficult for storms to form. Long says there was quite a bit of wind shear this year, which kept the total number of storms average.\n\nClimate computer models suggest that there will be more wind shear in the part of the Atlantic where hurricanes form as the Earth continues to warm.\n\nTaken together, that means a hotter planet will likely mean fewer total hurricanes, but higher percentage will be large, powerful storms .\n\nThe 2025 season \"happens to fit that mold extremely well,\" McNoldy says.\n\nNot every hurricane season will look like this. Even though the climate is steadily warming, and ocean temperatures are consistently above-average in the Atlantic, there's still a lot of variability in how many storms form and how powerful they get in any given year."

        "content": "As the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season ends, the future of forecasting is AI\n\ntoggle caption Ricardo Makyn/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMIAMI — The Atlantic hurricane season, which draws to an official close on Sunday, fulfilled forecasts it would be an active year.\n\nThere were 13 named storms and three Category 5 hurricanes. But, for the first time in a decade, a hurricane did not make landfall in the U.S.\n\nThe season's most destructive hurricane, Melissa, was one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever. It slammed Jamaica with 185 mph winds, devastating communities and killing dozens of people.\n\nA week before the hurricane made landfall, however, forecast models disagreed on where it would go. One model that got it right — accurately predicting Melissa's path and its Category 5 intensity — was a new one: Google's DeepMind AI-based hurricane model.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLoading...\n\nJames Franklin, a former branch chief at the National Hurricane Center, analyzed how the forecast models performed this year and says Google's DeepMind outshone them all. \"The model performed very, very well, which was very impressive,\" he says. \"It was the best guidance we saw this year.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence has been used in weather forecast models for some time. Google's DeepMind, though, marks a significant step forward, one that suggests AI may soon overtake the physics-based models meteorologists have long relied on.\n\nModels like the Global Forecast System — the GFS — developed by NOAA, are based on equations that calculate how wind, moisture and heat move around in the atmosphere. The models utilize these equations to predict what might happen in the atmosphere, including the track and intensity of hurricanes.\n\ntoggle caption James Franklin\n\nAI models like Google's DeepMind, on the other hand, don't know anything about physics but focus instead on history. \"They have been developed to go back and look at historical records and tease out patterns and relationships about what has happened in the past in very subtle ways that a person could not extract on their own,\" Franklin says.\n\nTo develop their hurricane model, engineers at Google worked closely with scientists at the National Hurricane Center and Colorado State University's Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere. Kate Musgrave, a research scientist at CIRA, analyzes the performance of AI-based models, including the one developed by Google.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe says in the past, AI models did well with one part of a hurricane forecast — tracking the path of a storm, \"Because that is governed by large-scale influences in the atmosphere. Intensity, however, how strong a storm will be, is not captured well in the AI models.\" But the Google model did very well in forecasting intensity, she says, because it added historical data detailing how past hurricanes developed.\n\nMusgrave believes AI modeling may be the future not just for hurricanes, but also in forecasting other weather phenomena, everything from tornadoes to cold snaps.\n\nAs for hurricanes, as AI models develop, she believes meteorologists will be able to forecast tracks and intensity earlier than ever before, a vital improvement. She says, \"As the coastlines get more populated, we need more and more time to get people out of the way. So, forecasts further and further into the future become more important.\"\n\ntoggle caption Clarens Siffroy/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has embraced the new Google DeepMind model, referencing it in many of its forecast discussions, particularly as it tracked Hurricane Melissa.\n\nWallace Hogsett, a science operations officer at the National Hurricane Center, says, \"I think it's clear at this point that AI will be a component of the hurricane forecast process going forward.\" Additional AI models are under development by NOAA and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

        "content": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas has sued the utility company whose downed power lines sparked the largest wildfire in state history, a deadly blaze that destroyed homes and livestock and charred miles of landscape, causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday by state Attorney General Ken Paxton accuses Southwestern Public Service Company, which operates in Texas as Xcel Energy, of negligence in its upkeep of aging utility poles. It seeks to recover economic damages incurred by the state and prevent the company from passing those costs on to customers.\n\nThe Smokehouse Creek fire killed three people in 2024, burning through more than 1,500 square miles (3,885 square kilometers) in Texas before spilling into neighboring Oklahoma. Texas A&M Forest Service investigators determined it was ignited when a decayed utility pole snapped and fell, dropping Xcel power lines onto dry grass.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Minnesota-based company has acknowledged its equipment appeared to have sparked the wildfire. But the lawsuit claims the company had neglected to replace aging utility poles in the windswept Panhandle, some of which were nearly 100 years old and more than twice their typical lifespan of 40 years.\n\n“Xcel’s blatant negligence killed three Texans and caused unfathomable destruction in the Texas Panhandle,” Paxton said. “The company made false representations about its safety commitments and ignored warnings that its aging infrastructure needed immediate repair and to be updated.”\n\nThe fatalities related to the fire included a woman who was overtaken by flames after getting out of her truck, and another woman whose remains were found in her burned home. A fire chief in one of the hardest hit towns died while responding to a house fire.\n\nThe company disputed Paxton's claims of negligence and noted it had already accepted responsibility for equipment failure. Xcel said it has already paid out more than $361 million to settle 212 of 254 claims.\n\n“When the Attorney General’s office approached us earlier this year requesting information, we worked with them in good faith to try and find a consensus solution,” Xcel said in a statement. \"They chose to file litigation instead. We will review this litigation and vigorously defend ourselves against these allegations.”"

        "content": "Ace Aguirre was just two bites into his oatmeal on the morning of November 4 when he noticed something strange: mud had seeped onto the living room floor of his bungalow in Cotcot, a village in the Philippines’ Cebu province.\n\nThe moments that followed will be forever seared into Aguirre’s memory. His living room furniture floating; the terrifying few minutes when he wasn’t sure he’d be able to pry the front door open; his son praying to God as the water rose to their chests; his daughter, who can’t swim, perched high on a pillar as water and cars gushed by, inches from her feet.\n\n“I don’t know how we were able to survive. One detail that didn’t go our way and many of us could have died,” Aguirre told CNN.\n\nThat morning Typhoon Kalmaegi dumped over a month’s worth of rain, causing rivers and waterways in Cebu to swell and unleashing catastrophic flash flooding that killed more than 230 people nationwide.\n\nOne of the dead was Aguirre’s neighbor, a mother of two, who drowned when she became trapped in her kitchen. He had tried to save her but couldn’t get her out in time.\n\nTorrential downpours and deadly flooding in the tropical, disaster-prone Philippines are not new. But revelations in recent months that politicians, officials and contractors had looted billions of dollars from the nationwide program supposed to mitigate their effects have roiled the country.\n\nAguirre's daughter faces rising floodwaters on November 4 in her village of Cotcot, Liloan, in the Philippines' Cebu province. Virnalyn Catipay\n\nPrior to the deadly flooding, a citizens’ group in Cebu had called for an audit of flood control projects along the Cotcot River, upstream from where Aguirre lives, according to local media.\n\nThe scandal has embroiled dozens of high-ranking lawmakers and officials who allegedly received kickbacks to award contracts. Those revelations have sparked huge youth-led anti-government protests against corruption and wealthy elites, similar to those seen this year in Indonesia and Nepal.\n\nAguirre had been watching the political drama unfold far away in Manila, the capital, for months, but he didn’t expect it to come to his doorstep.\n\n“All of a sudden you become a direct victim,” he said. “It hits different.”\n\nThe flooding in November prompted Cebu’s governor Pamela Baricuatro to demand an investigation into the 26 billion pesos ($443 million) in flood-control projects in the province which officials in Manila admitted “should have been working” by the time disaster struck.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. later visited the region and promised to clear and clean the waterways, and de-clog drainage systems, in time for rainy season next year.\n\nThe previous July he had revealed a government flood control program worth more than 545 billion pesos ($9.2 billion) had been plagued by corruption.\n\nHe said an internal audit found many of the 10,000 projects his government had overseen since he came to power in 2022 had been built using substandard materials or not at all, he said, referring to the projects as “ghost projects.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Philippine government for comment.\n\nWhen Marcos Jr exposed the fraud, he “opened a can of worms” that has since spun out of his control, said Sol Iglesias, associate professor of Political Science at the University of the Philippines.\n\nThis aerial photo shows damaged houses in the aftermath of Typhoon Kalmaegi in Talisay, in Cebu province on November 5, 2025. Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTestimonies in the House and Senate have revealed “an entire system of plunder and corruption that has been facilitated by the very agencies that were responsible for budgeting, planning, implementing, monitoring and checking on the financial soundness of these infrastructures,” Iglesias said.\n\nIn September, Finance Secretary Raph Recto told a Senate hearing up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2 billion) in funding for flood control may have been lost to corruption in the past two years, according to the Associated Press news agency.\n\nMarcos Jr has vowed to jail at least 37 congressmen and other officials responsible for the scams by Christmas, and seven have been thrown behind bars so far. The government has also frozen about 12 billion pesos ($204 million) in assets of individuals linked to the scandal.\n\nThe scandal has galvanized ordinary Filipinos, who have taken to the streets to protest decades of unchecked corruption.\n\n“This is the last straw for the Filipino people,” said Tiffany Faith Brillante, the head of Youth Rage Against Corruption in the Philippines, which has been involved in the protests.\n\nFilipino activists protest near the presidential palace on Human Rights Day in Manila, Philippines on December 10, 2025. Eloisa Lopez/Reuters\n\n“The corruption today is no longer just a symptom of weak governance,” she said. “It’s deeply rooted in how power is held in the government, how budgets are allocated, and how accountability is constantly avoided.”\n\nMarcos Jr has insisted he did not know of the fraud being perpetrated. He has positioned himself as a corruption crusader, shaming those responsible for the graft and egging on the protesters.\n\nBut as more top-ranking officials have become implicated in the scandal, some have pointed the finger back at the president.\n\nOne of those people is Zaldy Co, a one-time Marcos Jr ally and former House appropriations committee chairperson, who has become one of the central figures accused in the scandal. He fled the country and is currently a fugitive.\n\nWhile in hiding, he posted a series of explosive videos to his social media account, accusing Marcos Jr and his family members of profiting from the corruption – charges which the president has denied.\n\nMarcos’s family members have also been caught up in the drama. Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, a cousin of Marcos, resigned as House Speaker in September over the controversy, though he has denied any involvement in the scandal.\n\nBeyond the scale of the alleged theft, what has made this scandal hit so hard is that for many Filipinos it feels like history is repeating itself, said Aries Arugay, a Filipino political scientist and visiting senior fellow at the Singapore-based think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\n“Corruption and the Marcoses are almost synonyms in Philippine politics,” Arugay said.\n\nMarcos Jr’s father, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, ruled the Philippines with an iron fist from 1965 until his ouster in 1986, with the country living under martial law for about half that time. His regime committed systemic human rights abuses and engaged in widespread corruption, stealing an estimated $10 billion from public coffers.\n\nThe flood control scandal has reminded Filipinos of the dark days many experienced under Marcos Sr. One of the biggest anti-corruption protests was held on a significant date, September 21, when in 1972 Marcos Sr imposed martial law.\n\nMarcos Jr’s landslide victory in 2022 marked an extraordinary comeback for the notorious political family, which critics claimed was made possible in part by disinformation campaigns which whitewashed the history of the Marcos era.\n\nAnd though officials have warned the looting of the flood prevention program may have started under Marcos’ predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, the disparity between the lifestyles of the elite and regular Filipinos has been a source of anger under the current president.\n\nPhilippines' President Ferdinand Marcos Jr speaks during a press conference at Malacanang Palace in Manila on November 13, 2025. Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSocial media videos posted by the children of wealthy politicians and contractors flaunting their lavish lifestyles have added salt to the wounds of angry citizens, Arugay said.\n\n“When people are being submerged in flood water, the politicians are in Paris, riding their private jets,” he said.\n\nThis backlash against so-called “nepo kids” mirrors similar anti-corruption protests across Asia this year, including in Indonesia and Nepal, where Gen-Z led protests overthrew the government.\n\nLike those protests, young people have been some of the loudest voices calling for accountability in the Philippines.\n\n“We inherit the consequences of corruption and systemic abuse in our country if the government continues to steal, oppress and ignore the people,” Brillante said.\n\n“We really want to hold accountable and jail every single official involved in corruption,” Brillante said.\n\n“President Marcos cannot be spared, because at the end of the day, he’s the one who signs and approves the national budget every single year.”\n\nWhile public confidence in Marcos Jr has wavered, he’s not likely to meet the same fate as his father, who was unseated in a public uprising.\n\nMarcos Jr is more than halfway through his six-year term, and Philippine presidents have single term limits, so he will not be eligible for re-election in 2028.\n\n“We haven’t seen the equivalent of a smoking gun,” Iglesias said.\n\n“But if (we get) that smoking gun, for example, evidence of his directly benefitting financially from this corruption, then that will I think push the administration over the edge. Right now, it’s teetering.”\n\nFilipinos march alongside an effigy depicting Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr during a protest against corruption in Manila, Philippines on November 30, 2025. Lisa Marie David/Getty Images\n\nRecent public opinion polling by the firm WR Numero found Marcos Jr’s satisfaction rating was 21% in November, a 14% drop from August.\n\nFor someone who came so close to losing everything, Aguirre is upbeat and grateful. But he’s not optimistic that this wave of public momentum will produce any meaningful change in the Philippines.\n\n“With our resilience, we can still move forward, but the quality of life will still be the same.”"

        "content": "Climate journalist Emma Pattee has been worried about the so-called big one—an off-the-charts earthquake—hitting her town in Portland, Ore., for some time now. She’s not alone: scientists estimate at least a 37 percent likelihood that such a temblor will strike the Pacific Northwest, which sits along the Cascadia subduction zone, in the next 50 years. In her debut novel Tilt, voted one of Scientific American’s best fiction books of 2025, Pattee explores this hypothetical day through the eyes of Annie, a Portland local who is nine months pregnant and shopping for cribs at IKEA when disaster strikes. Through the novel, Annie goes on an epic journey to get home and in doing so makes some profound discoveries.\n\nScientific American spoke with Pattee about what the inspiration for her book was and why it was so important for her to get the science right.\n\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nYour book opens with a detailed map of Portland. Why did you decide to focus on this location?\n\nI came to this idea, like so many writers, because I live in Portland and I’m a climate journalist. I was at IKEA, and the idea came to me; I knew that I wanted to write something hyperrealistic, not realizing how hard of a challenge it would be to write a “nonfiction fiction” book about something that hasn’t happened yet.\n\nAs a science journalist, what science messages do you hope readers will take away from this book?\n\nJust to be clear, this is not a work of climate fiction, though certainly it is an allegory of climate fiction. I think what I hope people will take from the book is that the “big” earthquake is not a scenario where everyone is going to die. And in Portland around the time I was writing, that’s how a lot of people talked about this hypothetical earthquake, saying things like, “What’s the point of prepping—because everyone’s just going to die.” Very few people were speaking in a grounded way. Something that came from writing this book is the understanding that not that many people are going to die in the earthquake, but you are going to deeply want water, and the people around you are going to need water, and you’re going to feel like such a bad human that you didn’t get water for the vulnerable and sick people around you.\n\nWhy did you decide to explore this hypothetical earthquake through fiction?\n\nI think a lot of really great nonfiction has already been written about this earthquake. There’s a book called Full-Rip 9.0 by Sandi Doughton. It’s fantastic. There’s the Pulitzer Prize–winning article in the New Yorker by Kathryn Schulz about earthquake risk in the Pacific Northwest; there’s not much I could add to that. What interested me the most is that you can write so much about science, but people still struggle to take it home, to see how it’s going to impact their lives. I started to feel like a lot of the work I was doing around climate change was just writing for other scientists. There’s really not a lot written that would just tell a regular person living in Portland what they might need to expect, emotionally or otherwise.\n\nThe story does a good job of not sensationalizing or invoking too much fear in the reader, but it also illustrates that a mega earthquake would be very bad. It almost sounds like a kind of preparedness exercise for you. Is that accurate?\n\nI don’t think it was a preparedness prompt mainly because, without spoiling the ending, she’s not prepared! I’m not prepared for the earthquake. How do we live under the shadow of something that’s coming that everyone says we should get prepared for, but there’s actually no way to prepare for it? That’s climate change, and that’s an earthquake that’s going to destroy our city. But that’s also parenthood and having a child. I think that was more what I was writing about than, like, how could someone life-hack the earthquake, which I still don’t know.\n\nThis book is disturbingly mundane in parts; I think your opening scene is the perfect example of this. Why did you start off with Annie shopping in IKEA?\n\nI’m sure a lot of that is about my work as a climate journalist. I would talk to these scientists, and then we would turn off the recorder and have these incredibly painful conversations; then I would have to grab my kid from school and go food shopping. I’m somehow holding this idea that we potentially are looking at extinction, and I still have to go get yelled at by a daycare teacher because I brought the wrong size diapers. I am very interested in that aspect of modern life right now. In the beginning Annie is so shaped by consumerism, and the earthquake literally shakes her free of that. At the end, she maybe comes back to her more authentic, beastly form. That’s terrifying, but in some ways, is that also beautiful?\n\nHow did you keep track of Annie through time and space so closely?\n\nI extensively used Google Maps and mapped her route. I wrote a lot of this book on the streets where it happened. I wrote a lot of this book in IKEA. I spent so much time in these physical spaces, really trying to describe things as accurately as possible. I went to an earthquake drill at a brick school [building]. I went to an emergency training day with our neighborhood emergency teams here, and I had first-person interviews with people who were on site after major earthquakes in China [in 2008] and in [the autonomous region Azad Kashmir in Pakistan in 2005]. I even rode a bike while 40 weeks pregnant because people kept saying they didn’t think the bike scene was believable. I worked with a graduate student—basically we came up with the magnitude of earthquake and picked the date the earthquake was going to happen. We came up with how much rainfall there had been so we could come up with soil conditions. That level of accuracy almost became a North Star for me. I do think it’s a really hard way to write fiction, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody.\n\nOne feature of the novel that stood out was your use of flashbacks. Were you just giving the reader a breath, or is there something else that you were trying to explore?\n\nYeah, I mean, 9/11 was the primary source material that I used for this book. I really leaned so heavily on 9/11 accounts. I read a lot of accounts about people [who needed] to take long walks to get home and along the way came to really big decisions about their lives. And that was so interesting to me. Why does Annie need to change her life? And why does this change feel sort of impossible without the earthquake? I think for her it’s also about the sort of internal inventory of her life. I’ve met people who have experienced this suspended moment in time where their priorities became really, really clear, and you have a chance to change your life. For me, that is the central message of the book: there’s still time to change your life.\n\nOne of the most harrowing scenes involves Annie finding some parents who are looking for their lost children in a collapsed school building. How did you keep that scene so touching as a human and also scientifically accurate?\n\nThe school scene was very complicated for me because there are almost two dozen schools here in Portland at risk of collapse in a large earthquake. As I was writing the book, I really learned how this is a profound moral dilemma to send children to school in buildings like that. I felt such a moral weight about writing a scene like that; it was so important to me that it was very accurate. I brought in actual rescue experts to read that and tell me if it was realistic. I am a parent of young children in Portland. A lot of my friends have kids who go to those schools. It was really important that I wasn’t going to make it worse than it would be and I wasn’t going to make it better than it would be. In a sort of a strange twist of fate, the local paper here ran that scene the week my book was published next to a reported article that I wrote. There was just an enormous amount of uproar from it that pushed the school board to commit to fixing 10 of the most dangerous brick buildings, which was something that parents had been working on for more than a decade.\n\nHow did writing this book change your perspective on earthquakes, humanity and life in general?\n\nWhen I started writing it, I thought a big earthquake meant people would be breaking into my home to take my food and water. I have had such a profound shift. Part of that is becoming a parent and being much more connected to my community. I really started to see that my goal in preparing for the earthquake is not so that I have food and water for myself and my kids but that I have enough to share with the most vulnerable people on my street. Preparedness, for me, has become more of a civic duty—shifting from this feeling of fear to thinking it might actually be an opportunity where I could help other people fills me with so much meaning.\n\nCan you tell me what other books on this subject—or that you used in your research or maybe that you’ve read recently—you could recommend?\n\nFor my research I read The Dog Stars by Peter Heller. I read a book called Wave by Sonali Deraniyagala, who lost her children in the tsunami in the Indian Ocean. It is a very, very intense read. I’m reading a book called Confidence by Rafael Frumkin, and it’s fantastic. Another book that really had a big impact on me was Weather by Jenny Offill, a fictional book about climate change."

We appreciate that,” she said.\n\nKristi Noem thanked the president for keeping hurricanes at bay in Tuesday's Cabinet meeting. ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe quote seemed like a joke and got a laugh in the room.

This proved fortunate for the U.S., as FEMA was in turmoil throughout 2025, to the point that its staffers openly warned Trump that he was opening himself up to a Katrina-level disaster.\n\nTrump has spent much of 2025 threatening to cut FEMA entirely, saying disaster relief should be left to the states. The Trump administration’s first FEMA director, Cameron Hamilton, was fired in May for saying he disagreed with Trump’s vision to “wean off of FEMA.”\n\nThe organization was hit by DOGE-related staffing cuts and so-called “efficiency” measures that hampered the organization’s effectiveness following the deadly Texas floods that killed more than 100 people over the July 4th weekend.\n\nIt took Noem 72 hours to deploy FEMA after July's deadly floods in Texas. Chip Somodevilla/Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nFEMA’s acting administrator, David Richardson, who was appointed to the gig with no disaster response experience, was nowhere to be found in the 24 hours following the floods. This froze FEMA from acting immediately, as a Trump-era cost-cutting rule required Richardson to sign off on expenditures over $100,000. Richardson was on vacation at the time of the flood and had his work phone on silent.\n\nThough the DHS boasted in August that FEMA’s disaster response time was up “126 percent,” it took Noem 72 hours to deploy FEMA to Texas. Texas residents couldn’t call FEMA because the organization had fired its call center contractors.\n\nAs a result of FEMA’s costly mismanagement of the floods, the organization’s search and rescue chief, Ken Pagurek, resigned in frustration.\n\nActing FEMA head David Richardson resigned in mid-November. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Imag\n\nRichardson resigned as head of FEMA in mid-November after six months on the job. On Monday, the disaster response organization took on its third administrator of 2025, Karen Evans.\n\nThough Noem was joking in praising Trump for pushing the hurricanes away, the idea that the government can control the weather is a favorite conspiracy theory of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene."

Annabelle Chih/Getty Images\n\nTaiwan needs to focus on having the right weapons to deter and, if necessary, fight China in an full-scale war, a former top Taiwanese defense official said. Annabelle Chih/Getty Images\n\nTo prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nChina's grey-zone activities include regular military drills that practice blockades and invasions of Taiwan. GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan has ramped up military exercises focused on island defenses, including a large one earlier this year. Anadolu/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome."

Experts attribute this imbalance in part to men having a far lower life expectancy due to ill health and lifestyle choices, the World Atlas reported.\n\n“Men are about three times more likely to smoke, with 31% of the male population smoking compared to just 10% of the female population,” the site noted. “Men are also slightly more likely to be obese or overweight, with 62% of men being overweight or obese compared to 57% of women.”\n\nRenting husbands isn’t relegated to across the pond, either.\n\nIn 2022, mother of three Laura Young went viral after renting out her hubby James out to other women to do odd jobs for extra cash.\n\nThe lucrative business, dubbed “Rent My Handy Husband,” sees James go over and do everything, including general DIY, painting, decorating, tiling and carpet laying.\n\nJames, 42, is currently booked up for the month of November on jobs, for which he charges $44 per hour and about $280 for a day rate. Their business has become so popular, they said, that they even had to turn down jobs."

        "content": "PADANG, Indonesia (AP) — The death toll from last week’s catastrophic floods and landslides in parts of Asia surged past 1,500 Thursday as rescue teams raced to reach survivors isolated by the disaster with hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the region.\n\nThe latest figure came as meteorologists warned of renewed rainfall across North Sumatra, West Sumatra, and Aceh in coming days, sparking fears of further devastation in areas already reeling from deadly floods.\n\nThe tragedy was compounded by warnings that decades of deforestation caused by unchecked development, mining and palm oil plantations may have worsened the devastation. Calls grew for the government to act.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“We need the government to investigate and fix forest management,” said Rangga Adiputra, a 31-year-old teacher whose home in West Sumatra was swept away. The hills above his village on the outskirts of Padang city had been scarred by illegal logging.\n\n“We don’t want this costly disaster to happen again,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities said 836 people were confirmed dead in Indonesia, 479 in Sri Lanka and 185 in Thailand, as well as three in Malaysia.\n\nMany villages in Indonesia and Sri Lanka remained buried under mud and debris, with 859 people still unaccounted for in both countries.\n\nThousands reportedly faced severe shortages of food and clean water in cut off areas. The floods and landslides washed away roads and bridges and knocked out telecommunications, leaving many communities inaccessible.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIndonesian television showed images of huge amounts of felled timber carried downstream in North Sumatra, West Sumatra and Aceh provinces.\n\nThe leading Indonesian environmental group WALHI said that decades of deforestation — driven by mining, palm oil plantations, and illegal logging — stripped away natural defenses that once absorbed rainfall and stabilized soil.\n\n“The disaster was not just nature’s fury, it was amplified by decades of deforestation,” said Rianda Purba, an activist with the group. “Deforestation and unchecked development have stripped Sumatra of its resilience.”\n\nThe group recorded more than 240,000 hectares (nearly 600,000 acres) of primary forest were lost in 2024 alone, leaving Sumatra’s small river basins dangerously exposed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnother environmental group, Global Forest Watch, has said the flood-inundated Indonesian provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have since 2000 lost 19,600 square kilometers (7,569 square miles) of forest, an area larger than the state of New Jersey.\n\n\"Unless restoration begins now, more lives will be lost,” Purba warned.\n\nPresident Prabowo Subianto pledged policy reforms after visiting flood-hit areas on Monday.\n\n\"We must truly prevent deforestation and forest destruction. Protecting our forests is crucial,” Prabowo said.\n\nIn Batang Toru, the worst-hit areas in North Sumatra, where seven companies operate, hundreds of hectares had been cleared for gold mining and energy projects, leaving slopes exposed and riverbeds choked with sediment. Rivers there were swollen with runoff and timber, while villages were buried or swept away.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLawmakers called for the companies' permits to be revoked.\n\nFacing public outrage, Environment Minister Hanif Faisol Nurofiq announced an investigation into eight companies suspected of worsening the disaster. He said environmental permits will be reviewed and future assessments must factor in extreme rainfall scenarios.\n\n“Someone must be held accountable,” he said.\n\nThe latest weather forecasts predict heavy showers and thunderstorms on Friday to Saturday, with saturated soil and swollen rivers leaving communities on edge.\n\n“The two-day forecast signals persistent wet conditions, with heavy rain expected during the day and night, and thunderstorms likely in several flood-prone districts,” said Teuku Faisal Fathani, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency chief.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor Safnida, a 67-year-old survivor, the forecast brings renewed anxiety.\n\n“We can’t expect life to always be good, right? I’m grateful to be alive while my house collapsed in the floods,” she said, sitting on a thin mat in an elementary school turned evacuation shelter in Padang city on Thursday.\n\n“At my age, I don’t know if I can still survive,” said Safnida, who goes by a single name like many Indonesians.\n\n___\n\nKarmini reported from Jakarta.
