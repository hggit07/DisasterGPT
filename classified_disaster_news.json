        "content": "Blue Origin astronaut reveals depression after 'tsunami of harassment'\n\nAmanda Nguyen, a bioastronautics research scientist and activist, was onboard the Blue Origin's New Shepard NS-31 rocket in April 2025\n\nSpeaking about the experience, Ms Nguyen - who became the first Vietnamese woman to go to space - said the backlash saw her dreams buried under \"an avalanche of misogyny\".\n\nThe much-derided flight was criticised by some for its expense and environmental impact.\n\nAmanda Nguyen - a 34-year-old scientist and civil rights activist - was part of the 11-minute Blue Origin space flight, which also included pop star Katy Perry and Lauren Sánchez, the journalist and wife of Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, among its crew.\n\nA Vietnamese-American astronaut has opened up about her depression after she received a \"tsunami of harassment\" following the first all-female space trip since 1963 earlier this year.\n\nWatch the moment the Blue Origin rocket launched and landed in April 2025.\n\nIn a statement posted on Instagram, Ms Nguyen said that when fellow crew member Gayle King - a US news anchor - called to check in on her in the days following the flight, \"I told her my depression might last for years\".\n\nShe described the news coverage and social media reaction that followed the trip as an \"onslaught no human brain has evolved to endure\".\n\n\"I did not leave Texas for a week, unable to get out of bed. A month later, when a senior staff at Blue [Origin] called me, I had to hang up on him because I could not speak through my tears.\"\n\nMs Nyugen, who has worked as a scientist researching women's health and conducted numerous experiments during the Blue Origin flight, said everything she \"had worked for - as a scientist, my women's health research, the years I had trained for this moment, the experiments I operated in space, the history that was being made as the first Vietnamese woman astronaut, on the 50th anniversary of the US-Vietnam war, as the child of boat refugees, the promise I kept to my survivor self [...] were buried under an avalanche of misogyny\".\n\nMs Nguyen is most recognised for her work protecting the civil rights of sexual assault survivors.\n\nShe put her own ambition to become an astronaut on hold after being raped while at university and pursuing a years-long campaign for justice, she told the Guardian in an interview in March.\n\nEight months on from realising her dream, she said the \"fog of grief has started to lift\", and thanked those who have followed her and sent her good wishes. \"You all saved me\", she said.\n\nShe added that despite the backlash, \"there has been overwhelming good that has come out of [the flight]\", listing the media attention brought to her women's health research and opportunities to meet world leaders in relation to her advocacy work.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard rocket lifted off from its Texas launch site in April and took the six-woman crew on an 11-minute flight which crossed the internationally recognised boundary of space.\n\nThe crew also included aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe and film producer Kerianne Flynn.\n\nThe New Shepard rocket does not require human operation and is fully automated.\n\nBlue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon."

        "content": "The nonprofit Watch Duty is partnering with Ring, the Amazon-owned maker of doorbell cameras, to help users share videos of nearby wildfires on Watch Duty’s wildfire tracking app.\n\nThe result is Fire Watch, a new feature being added to Ring’s Neighbors app, the stand-alone service that lets users see activity from nearby Ring cameras. If there is a fire in the area, users will be notified and can go into an emergency mode that lets them share videos from their Ring cameras to the feed about that specific fire on Watch Duty’s platform.\n\nCourtesy of Ring\n\nIt's not a posting free-for-all; Watch Duty says it will choose which Ring videos to show in Fire Watch, based on relevance. Ring says Fire Watch will roll out to Neighborhood app users this spring.\n\nThe announcement comes at the one year anniversary of the 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles, which leveled entire neighborhoods, caused billions of dollars in damage, killed 30 people in the flames, and led to more than 400 deaths in total.\n\nWatch Duty, which lets users track wildfires and receive minute-by-minute updates about a blaze’s path and perimeter, became something of a lifeline for desperate LA residents looking for timely fire information. The mobile app saw 2.5 million new downloads during the LA fires and was widely hailed as a necessary resource.\n\nOne newfound Watch Duty user was Jamie Siminoff, the founder of Ring. While not at Ring at the time, he later rejoined the company after the Palisades fire burned his garage and parts of the back of his house. The experience of searching for information about where the fire was made him think that the Ring cameras all around him should have helped.\n\n“While I'm in it, I thought, why are we not doing this? And why are we not doing that?” Siminoff says. “A big part of why I wanted to come back was to do things like this with the Ring network and with our Ring customers.”\n\nFire Watch gets its real-time fire alerts from Watch Duty, and the feature notifies Neighbors users if a fire is nearby. There is also a feature to accept “voluntary community contributions” that lets Ring users opt in to sharing shots from their smart-home cameras with Watch Duty.\n\nCourtesy of Ring Courtesy of Ring\n\n“When you go into this mode, you'll get an alert as a Ring customer saying there's a massive fire in your area, basically, and would you like to assist Watch Duty with this?” Siminoff says. “You’re basically opening up your camera for the next 24 hours to donate your data.”\n\nThis is not the first third-party service Watch Duty has partnered with. It currently pulls map and fire perimeter information from official emergency services, then collates and regularly updates the information into an easily digestible feed on its app. Alert Wildfire, a service that powers a network of video cameras to spot fires, allows its videos to be included in Watch Duty’s reported feeds about individual fires. Watch Duty volunteers and users can also reach out individually to share their videos or photos."
